That’s why we believe that now is the perfect time to launch Vi, one company which provides the strength of Vodafone India and Idea,” Vodafone Group CEO Nick Read said at a virtual conference on Monday.\n\nVodafone Idea, once the largest telecom operator in the country with over 400 million subscribers, has lost more than 100 million subscribers in recent years to new comer Jio Platforms in recent years.\n\nIndia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani’s telecom venture has become the largest telecom operator with nearly 400 million subscribers with its cut-rate mobile data tariffs. Jio Platforms has also attracted over $20 billion in investment from high-profile firms including Facebook and Google in recent months.\n\n“India is the second largest telecom market and the largest data consumer, globally. With 1.2 billion Indians accessing voice and data services at the world’s lowest tariffs across 500,000 villages, the ubiquitous wireless network in India is unmatched for its reach and impact in people’s lives,” said Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman of Aditya Birla Group and Vodafone Idea, at the conference today.W\n\n“With our new brand — Vi, we stand committed to partner with government to accelerate India’s progression towards a digital economy, enabling millions of citizens to connect to the digital revolution and build a better tomorrow.”\n\nIf the brand name changes yet again!\n\nIt will bem at least, the 9th iteration for both the companies Voda-India’s Previous Brand Names\n\n– Max Touch\n\n– Orange\n\n– Hutch\n\n– Vodafone Idea’s Previous Brand Names\n\n– Birla AT&T\n\n– Birla Tata and AT&T\n\n– Idea Cellular Together: VODAFONE IDEA https://t.co/ovuY5M5Us4 — Mangalam Maloo (@blitzkreigm) September 7, 2020\n\nVodafone Idea — or Vi, has yet to turn a profit since it joined forces.

The company received a much needed relief in India earlier this month after nation’s apex court granted Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, another giant telecom operator in India, with 10 years to pay billions they owe to the government.\n\nPrior to the court ruling, Vodafone Group had warned that Indian government’s short-deadline of three months to clear the dues was not feasible for the telecom firm and it would have no choice but to exit the market.\n\nVodafone Idea’s shares, which were up 10% in morning trade, were 3.30% immediately after the announcement Monday."

  "title_summary": "Facebook addresses political controversy in India, monetization opportunities, startup investments – TechCrunch At the beginning of the previous decade, Facebook had a tiny presence in India. It had just started to slowly expand its team in the country and was inking deals with telecom operators to make access to its service free to users and even offer incentives such as free voice credit.\n\nIndia’s internet population, now the second largest with more than 500 million connected users, itself was very small. In early 2011, the country had fewer than 100 million internet users.\n\nBut Facebook ended up playing a crucial role in the last decade. So much so that by the end of it, the social juggernaut was reaching nearly every internet user in the country. WhatsApp alone reaches more than 400 million internet users in India, more than any other app in the country, according to mobile insight firm App Annie.\n\nThis reach of Facebook in India didn’t go unnoticed. Politicians in the country today heavily rely on Facebook services, including WhatsApp, to get their message out. But it has also complicated things.\n\nRumors have spread on WhatsApp that cost lives, and politicians from both the large political parties in India in recent weeks have accused the company of showing favoritism to the other side.\n\nTo address these issues, and the role Facebook wishes to play in India, Ajit Mohan, the head of the company’s business in the country, joined us at Disrupt 2020. Following are some of the highlights.\n\nOn controversy\n\nA recent report in WSJ claimed that Ankhi Das, one of Facebook’s top executives in India, decided against taking down a post from a politician from the ruling party. She did so, the report claimed, because she feared it could hurt the company’s business prospects in India.\n\nIn Mohan’s first interview since the controversy broke, he refuted the claims that any executive in the country holds power to influence how Facebook enforces its content policy.\n\n“We believe that it’s important for us to be open and neutral and non-partisan,” he said. “We have deep belief and conviction that our enabling role is as a neutral party that allows speech of all kinds, that allows expression of all kinds, including political expression, and a lot of the guidelines that we have developed are to make sure that we really enable our diversity of expression and opinion so long as we’re able to make sure that the safety and security of people are protected.”\n\nMohan said the internal processes and systems inside Facebook are designed to ensure that any opinion and preference of an employee or a group of employees is “quite separate from the company and the company’s objective enforcement of its own policies.”\n\nHe said individuals can offer input on decisions, but nobody — including Ankhi Das — can unilaterally influence the decision Facebook takes on content enforcement.\n\n“We do allow free expression inside the company as well. We don’t have any constraints on people expressing their point of view, but we see that separate from the enforcement of our content policy. […] The content policy itself, in the context of India, is a team that stands separate from the public policy team that is led by Ankhi,” he added.\n\nOn India and monetization\n\nEven as Facebook has amassed hundreds of millions of users in India, the world’s second largest market contributes little to its bottom line. So why does Facebook care so much about the country?\n\n“India is in the middle of a very exciting economic and social transformation where digital has a massive role to play. In just the last four years, more than 500 million users have come online. The pace of this transformation probably has no parallel in either human history or even in the digital transformation happening in countries around the world,” he said.\n\n“For a company like ours, if you look at the family of apps across WhatsApp and Instagram, we believe we have a useful role to play in fueling this transformation,” he said.\n\nEven as Facebook does not generate a lot of revenue from India, Mohan said the company has established itself as one of the most trusted platforms for marketers. “They look to us as a material partner in their marketing agenda,” he said.\n\nHe said the company is hopeful that advertising as a GDP will go up in India. “Therefore ad-revenue will become substantial over time,” he said.\n\nFor Facebook, India is also crucial because it allows the company to build some unique products that solve issues for India but could be replicated in other markets. The company is currently testing an integration of WhatsApp, which currently does not have a business model despite having over 2 billion users, with new Indian e-commerce JioMart, to allow users to easily track their orders.\n\n“We think there is opportunity to build India-first models, experiment at scale, and in a world where we succeed, we see huge opportunity in taking some of these models global,” he said.\n\nFacebook as a VC\n\nFacebook does not usually invest in startups. But in India, the company has invested in social-commerce firm Meesho, online learning platform Unacademy — it even participated in its follow-up round — and it wrote a $5.7 billion check to Jio Platforms earlier this year. So why is Facebook taking this investment route in India?\n\n“We wanted to create a program for taking minority investments in early-stage startups to figure out how we could be helpful to startup founders and the ecosystem as a whole. The starting point was backing teams that were building models that in some ways were unique to India and could go global. Since we made an investment in Meesho, they have made a strong thrust in Indonesia. These are the kind of companies where we feel we can add value as well as we can learn from these startups,” he said.\n\nThe partnership with Jio Platforms follows a different rationale. “The transformation we talked about in India in the last few years, Jio triggered it,” he said. Other than that, Facebook is exploring ways to work with Jio, such as with its partnership with Jio’s venture JioMart. “It can really fuel the small and medium business that is good for the Indian economy,” he said.\n\nMohan said the company continues to explore more opportunities in Indian startups, especially with those where the teams think Facebook can add value, but he said there is no mandate of any kind that Facebook has to invest in, say dozens of startups in three to four years. “It’s not a volume play,” he said.\n\nBut would these firms, including Reliance Industries, which operates Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail, will receive any special access on Facebook’s services. What if Amazon, BigBasket, Grofers, or Flipkart want to integrate with WhatsApp, too? Mohan said Facebook platform is open for every firm and everyone will receive the same level of access and opportunities.\n\nIn the interview, Mohan, who ran the Disney-run Hotstar on-demand streaming service in India, also talked about the growing usage of video in India, the state of WhatsApp Pay’s rollout in the country, what Facebook thinks of India’s ban on Chinese apps, and much more. You can watch the full interview below."

  "title_summary": "YouTube launches its TikTok rival, YouTube Shorts, initially in India – TechCrunch As TikTok’s fate in the U.S. remains murky, YouTube today announced the launch of a new short-form video experience it’s calling YouTube Shorts. The feature will allow users, initially in India, to upload 15-second or less short-form videos using a new set of creator tools, including a multi-segment camera, similar to TikTok, speed controls and a timer and a countdown feature. The videos can also be set to music, thanks to YouTube’s access to a large library of songs that it says will continue to grow over time.\n\nThe multi-segment camera lets users string together multiple video clips into one short clip. The other controls enable YouTube creators to be more creative than if they simply pressed a “record” button.\n\nThese are tools common to the TikTok video recording experience today and are the same features that Instagram recently cloned for its own TikTok rival, known as Reels.\n\nThe feature will be prominently highlighted within the YouTube app on Android, and will expand to iOS in time.\n\nYouTube says India — notably, a large market where Chinese-owned TikTok is already banned — will be the first to gain access to YouTube Shorts at launch. However, the plan is to bring the feature to more markets in time. YouTube didn’t offer a timeline for when that would happen, though.\n\nRelated to this, YouTube will introduce a new watch experience that lets you swipe through YouTube Shorts vertically — also, just like TikTok. The company had already added a new row on the YouTube homepage for watching short videos, and now the new watch experience will make it easier to watch that content and discover new short videos, too, YouTube says.\n\nYouTube earlier this summer announced its plans to begin testing a short-form video feature, but hadn’t offered many details, or even the feature’s name. At the time, YouTube had said that the test would involve recording 15-second videos on both iOS and Android, but only among a small group of creators.\n\nThe company clarified to TechCrunch that this earlier experiment had been part of the Shorts product, and it had been experimenting with a multi-segment camera globally. But new today are the options to record with music, speed controls and a timer and countdown.\n\nIn addition, YouTube Shorts will feature hundreds of thousands of tracks from partners like T-Series and Believe Digital. It’s also working with music artists, labels and publishers to make more of their content available in YouTube Shorts’ catalog.\n\nThe news of the larger launch of YouTube Shorts comes as the M&A deadline for TikTok’s U.S. operations is coming to an end. Microsoft has now announced it won’t be the buyer, and reports claim Oracle is winning the bid, but its deal isn’t structured as an outright sale.\n\nTikTok’s potential exit had already seen many rival social platforms looking to woo TikTok users to their own app. Instagram, Snapchat and now YouTube are among those looking to gain an advantage by leveraging the instability around TikTok to launch their own short-form video products. More direct TikTok competitors, like Triller, Dubsmash, Byte and others, have picked up some new customers, as well.\n\nYouTube says the new feature is rolling out in India over the next few days. It characterizes YouTube Shorts as a test it aims to learn from, with the goal of expanding access and improving the product over time.\n\nIf you have access to the Shorts camera, you can start creating videos by hitting the plus (+) icon (or soon, the video camera icon on iOS), then selecting “video.” If you see “create a short video” as an option, then you have the Shorts camera. For Android users in India, however, you’ll see the “create” icon has been moved to the bottom of the navigation bar for easier access, YouTube says.\n\nThose without the feature can somewhat participate by tagging their shorter videos (under 60 seconds) as #Shorts in the title or description. These will be tested on the new YouTube home page, along with other short vertical videos."

  "title_summary": "Groww, an investment app for millennials in India, raises $30M led by YC Continuity – TechCrunch Even as more than 150 million people are using digital payment apps each month in India, only about 20 million of them invest in mutual funds and stocks. A startup that is attempting to change that by courting millennials has just received a big backing.\n\nBangalore-headquartered Groww said on Thursday it had raised $30 million in its Series C financing round. YC Continuity, the growth-stage investment fund of Y Combinator, led the round, while existing investors Sequoia India, Ribbit Capital and Propel Ventures participated in it. The new round brings three-year-old startup Groww’s total raise-to-date to $59 million.\n\nGroww allows users to invest in mutual funds, including systematic investment planning (SIP) and equity-linked savings. The app maintains a very simplified user interface to make it easier for its largely millennial customer base to comprehend the investment world. It offers every fund that is currently available in India.\n\nIn recent months, the startup has expanded its offerings to allow users to buy stocks of Indian firms and digital gold, said Lalit Keshre, co-founder and chief executive of Groww, in an interview with TechCrunch. Keshre and other three co-founders of Groww worked at Flipkart before launching their own startup.\n\nGroww has amassed over 8 million registered users for its mutual fund offering, and over 200,000 users have bought stocks from the platform, said Keshre. The new fund will allow Groww to further expand its reach in the country and also introduce new products, he said.\n\nOne of those products is the ability to allow users to buy stocks of U.S.-listed firms and derivatives, he said. The startup is already testing this with select users, he said.\n\n“We believe Groww is building the largest retail brokerage in India. At YC, we have known the founders since the company was just an idea and they are some of the best product people you will meet anywhere in the world. We are grateful to be partners with Groww as they build one of the largest retail financial platforms in the world,” said Anu Hariharan, partner at YC Continuity, in a statement.\n\nMore than 60% of Groww users come from smaller cities and towns of India and 60% of these have never made such investments before, said Keshre. The startup is conducting workshops in several small cities to educate people about the investment world. And that’s where the growth opportunities lie.\n\n“India is seeing increased participation of retail investors in financial markets — with 2 million new stock market investors added in the last quarter alone,” said Ashish Agrawal, principal at Sequoia Capital India, in a statement.\n\nScores of startups such as Zerodha, ETMoney, INDWealth and Cube Wealth have emerged and expanded in India in recent years to offer wealth management platforms to the country’s growing internet population. Many established financial firms such as Paytm have also expanded their offerings to include investments in mutual funds. Amazon, which has aggressively expanded its financial services catalog in India in recent months, also sells digital gold in the country."

The LanzaTech gasifier, which will be built in partnership with Indian project development firm Ankur Scientific, will use waste to make ethanol and chemicals rather than power.\n\nWhile most of the industry uses large-scale, expensive oxygen-blown gasifiers to make liquids, the LanzaTech air-blown technology is much cheaper and easier to operate and can still produce bacteria at a scale that produces a meaningful amount of ethanol.\n\nContamination also isn’t an issue with the gas feedstock for LanzaTech’s bacteria, according to LanzaTech CEO Jennifer Holmgren . The new process can produce biochar that ends up replacing fertilizer in soil and thereby reducing nitrogen oxide emissions, which are another greenhouse gas contributing to global climate change.\n\nIf the pilot project is successful and the gasifiers are rolled out at scale across India, it could mean an ability for the country to produce roughly 25 billion liters of ethanol per year and result in removing 60 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to LanzaTech’s estimates.\n\n“Overall something that people said makes no sense, may well make sense and may well result in benefits beyond just the immediate reuse of waste agri carbon and production of a fuel that results in keeping some petroleum in the ground,” according to a statement from Holmgren. “Holistic systems thinking is the way.”\n\nFor Holmgren, the small pilot project in India is an example of how small-scale, low-cost distributed systems can compete with the big oil industry.\n\n“There are two paths to scale, bigger which is cheaper per unit produced, or massively replicating a small scale unit (numbering up versus scaling up),” Holmgren said. “Most people have always believed that numbering up is for toys and food, but I think it will also fit process technology. Certainly, larger fits petroleum, but it can’t fit biotechnology or biomass or waste gases which are distributed and difficult to move.”\n\nDecarbonization, Holmgren believes, will require a reimagining of traditional systems if humanity is to break the carbon cycle that’s now causing global climate catastrophes that can be observed in the Western United States right now.\n\n“We must not benchmark today’s innovation against the past; we must, instead, imagine and create a very different future, one where the production of energy, fuels and chemicals is based on distributed, rather than centralized principles,” said Holmgren. “Recent breakthroughs in miniaturization, automation, AI and 3D printing enable distributed production beyond anything that could have been previously imagined and of course, a simple gasifier will help that along.”"

The social giant today announced a grant of $4.3 million for more than 3,000 small businesses across Delhi, Gurgaon, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore (Indian cities where the company has its offices).\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Ajit Mohan, head of Facebook India, said the grant includes both cash and ad credits, with cash constituting the larger share. These businesses don’t have to advertise on Facebook to be eligible for the grant, he said. Businesses can apply for the grant starting today.\n\nThe India grant is part of the company’s $100 million global grant for small businesses that it announced in March.\n\nAdditionally, Facebook and Instagram have also launched capabilities for businesses in India to sell gift cards. “During the pandemic, it’s been inspiring to see how people and businesses have come together on the Facebook family of apps to support their local communities,” said Mohan.\n\nThese gift cards, which will be issued by startups Qwikcilver and PayU, are designed to help businesses get the immediate cash flow to stay afloat. Users can redeem these gift cards at these businesses later on.\n\nThe announcement today comes as Facebook begins to engage deeply with small businesses in the country. The company invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms earlier this year and said it would work with the Indian giant to explore ways to serve the nation’s 60 million businesses.\n\n“The recovery of small businesses from the pandemic will be critical to the recovery of Indian economy, and we want to do everything we can to help. Today we’re building on our commitment by announcing the small business grant for India,” said Mohan.\n\nScores of businesses in India already use Facebook to reach potential customers. WhiteHat Jr., an 18-month-old startup that teaches coding to kids, is one of the businesses that has used Facebook extensively in recent quarters. The startup was acquired by Indian decacorn Byju’s for $300 million last month.\n\nMore on Facebook’s business in India tomorrow. Mohan will be joining us at the Disrupt 2020 conference."

It allows social commerce sellers, or people who use social media platforms and messaging apps like WhatsApp to sell items, make extra cash by creating affiliate links to major e-commerce sites like Amazon and Flipkart. The launch of EarnKaro also allowed CashKaro to reach into smaller cities and rural areas, where shoppers often prefer to order from people whose recommendations they trust (i.e. “micro-influencers”) instead of e-commerce sites.\n\nFounded in 2013 by husband-and-wife team Swati and Rohan Bhargava, CashKaro currently claims about five million users and has partnerships with more than 1,500 e-commerce sites, including some of the biggest players in India, like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra and Ajio. The company monetizes by charging brands a commission for transactions made through CashKaro links. The commissions are also how CashKaro is able to give cash back to shoppers, which can be deposited into their bank accounts or redeemed as gift vouchers for Flipkart and Amazon. CashKaro’s founders say it currently processes more than one million monthly transactions.\n\nCashKaro competes for the attention of online shoppers with a bevy of other coupon and cashback services in India. Some of its rivals include CouponDunia, GrabOn and GoPaisa.\n\n“We are the only VC-funded cashback site in India. While capital itself is not the differentiator, it is what we have been able to do with that capital which sets us apart,” Bhargava told TechCrunch, adding that CashKaro’s cashback rates are among the highest in the market.\n\n“Given that we now drive close to a half a billion dollars in GMV through CashKaro and EarnKaro to our partner sites, we are able to get higher commission rates from partner sites, which in turn helps us pass the most benefit to our members.”\n\nWhile COVID-19 has affected e-commerce businesses around the world because of sudden changes in consumer habits, the situation in India was particularly complicated in April and May because there were containment zones throughout the country, and in some zones, deliveries of non-essential items were not allowed until May.\n\n“COVID-19 caught us by surprise and Indian e-commerce was neither prepared to handle the surge in demand, nor did we expect so many supply side and delivery issues,” said Bhargava. “Given CashKaro works with all e-commerce sites, we saw these trends as well.”\n\nSince June, however, sales have started to recover and is seeing growth as people continue to stay home and shop online.\n\n“Our business is growing month on month and, in fact, the pandemic spurred our expansion into new digital categories, like education, gaming and online video streaming, which have seen exponential growth,” Bhargava added. Sales of electronics, home and kitchen items, personal care and beauty have also increased over the past few months.\n\nAt the same time, the economic impact of the pandemic has prompted more people to seek cashback offers and other money-saving deals.\n\n“We are seeing that saving consciousness has gone up amongst online shoppers and people are finding services like CashKaro and EarnKaro more useful than ever before,” Bhargava said. “On the client side, our partners, such as Amazon, Myntra and Ajio, are also working with us more closely because they are seeing that our performance marketing model is the perfect way to scale while keeping profitability in mind amidst these tough times.”\n\nThe new round of capital will be used for CashKaro’s goal of doubling its registered member base over the next 12 months from the current 5 million. Bhargava told TechCrunch that it will expand cashback offers into categories like credit cards and education, and launch new marketing campaigns focused around events like upcoming festivals and the Indian Premier League season, which starts this weekend.\n\nThe company is also “chasing aggressive growth for EarnKaro and reaching out to more influencers, resellers, housewives and students who are our primary target market for this product,” she added. Finally, part of the Series B will be used for hiring, including leadership positions.\n\nFor Korea Investment Partners, one of the largest South Korean venture capital firms, CashKaro represents a chance to tap into India’s fast-growing e-commerce market. In a statement, managing partner Hudson Kyung-sik Ho said, “We believe this is a highly scalable opportunity and both Swati and Rohan have set it on a truly exciting growth trajectory. CashKaro and EarnKaro together have shown exceptional unit metrics and we are really excited to be a part of India’s affiliate story.”"

  "title_summary": "Virtual events platform Airmeet raises $12M – TechCrunch Airmeet, a startup that offers a platform to host virtual events, said on Tuesday it has raised $12 million in a new financing round as the Bangalore-headquartered firm demonstrates accelerating growth in its user base.\n\nSequoia Capital India led the $12 million Series A financing round in one-year-old Airmeet. Redpoint Ventures and existing investors Accel India, Venture Highway, Global Founders Capital (GFC) and Gokul Rajaram (Caviar Lead at DoorDash) also participated in the round.\n\nThe new round values Airmeet at about $50 million, more than double of what it was valued in March, when it raised $3 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAirmeet allows users and businesses to host interactive virtual events. Its platform intuitively replicates aspects of a physical event, offering a backstage, grouping people to a table, allowing participants to network with each other and even enabling event organizers to work with sponsors. Airmeet, currently in public beta, is available through a freemium model where it charges businesses based on their usage.\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Lalit Mangal, co-founder of Airmeet, said the usage on the platform has grown 2,000% over the last quarter without any investment in advertisement, he said.\n\nIn recent months, Airmeet has worked to expand the use cases of the platform. In addition to hosting large conferences, Airmeet is now also being used for professional meetups at large film festivals, he said. Recently it held university resource fairs and technical industry summits.\n\n“Covid-19 has accelerated a permanent behavioral shift across many industries. With digitization of largely traditional spaces leapfrogging by years, the $800+ billion global offline events space is up for grabs. There is massive potential for players who drive the industry’s transition towards online-events,” said Abhishek Mohan, VP at Sequoia Capital India, in a statement.\n\nAirmeet is built on top of WebRTC, a standard that most modern browsers follow. This has enabled Airmeet to be fully accessible through Chrome and Firefox. All the sessions are also end-to-end encrypted, said Mangal. It does not have a mobile app. Mangal said people tend to use their laptop or desktop or their iPads for professional events. (Users can consume a session through their mobile browser, however.)\n\nThe startup, which is in the same space as Hopin and Andreessen Horowitz-backed Run The World, will use the fresh capital to add new features to Airmeet and also scale globally, said Mangal.\n\n“Airmeet’s mission is to create a global platform to enable millions of community managers and event organizers across the world to engage with and expand their audience. And with Lalit and team’s focus, execution and innovative thinking, they are strongly placed to achieve their goal,” said Mohan."

  "title_summary": "Indian decacorn Byju’s CEO talks about future acquisitions, coronavirus and international expansion – TechCrunch Since India enforced a lockdown across the country in late March, shutting schools and other public places, Bangalore-headquartered startup Byju’s has emerged as one of the quintessential platforms for school-going students in the world’s second largest internet market.\n\nIt took the startup about four and a half years to amass 40 million students. Since the lockdown, its user base has ballooned to 65 million, its co-founder and chief executive Byju Raveendran said at the Disrupt 2020 conference Tuesday.\n\nStudents say they were attracted to Byju’s platform because of the way it taught them subjects. Byju, who is a teacher himself, found intuitive ways like using real-life objects such as a pizza to teach complex math problems.\n\nHis startup is valued at nearly $11 billion as of last week (which makes it India’s second most valuable startup), and has presence across several international markets. Late last year, Byju’s announced it has also turned profitable. It’s not everyday that we see an Indian startup with any of these three characteristics — let alone all three in one.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview at Disrupt 2020, Raveendran shared the journey of Byju’s, which started as an offline platform that taught students at classrooms, auditoriums and stadiums; the startup’s plans for further expansion in international markets; his views on merger and acquisition opportunities; and how the coronavirus pandemic has affected his business and the education landscape at large in India, among a number of other things.\n\n“Unfortunately it took a pandemic for most stakeholders to try out digital learning. Parents are now accepting the online segment more than before. This sector is clearly at an inflexion point,” said Raveendran.\n\nTo make online learning more accessible to students, Byju’s made all of its offerings free during the pandemic. But the platform’s paying subscribers, now at more than 4 million, remains on a steady path of growth, he said.\n\nThe startup expects to generate more than $1 billion in revenue this year from India itself and take home profits between $150 million to $180 million, he said.\n\n“I would still call it a relative success. What we consider as the target audience, we have less than 4% of penetration in that segment,” he said. “More than one-third of school-going students don’t have a smartphone. There’s still a lot of catch up to do.”\n\nAnother phenomenon that the pandemic has kickstarted in India is some consolidation in the edtech startup space. Byju’s itself acquired WhiteHat Jr., an 18-month-old startup that teaches coding skills to students, for $300 million.\n\nTechCrunch has reported that the startup is engaging with several more startups, including Indian firm Doubtnut, which through its app allows students to take a picture of a math problem and delivers a step-by-step solution.\n\nHere’s what Raveendran had to say about that: “The long-term potential of the sector is at an all-time high. […] We are looking for companies that can add strong product components to either our existing user base or potential new customers in new markets, or companies that can give us some kind of distribution so that we get a head start to launch in a new market — especially English speaking markets.”\n\n“You will hear of a few more acquisitions from us. We are exploring some of them very seriously,” he added. The future acquisitions will again be all-cash deals, Raveendran said, as he “values equity more than others.”\n\nOn IPO, fundraise and international expansion\n\nByju’s isn’t looking to go public for at least two years, the chief executive said. “We have strong business fundamentals; we have been able to find the right balance between high-growth and sustainable growth and created a very profitable model in such a short period of time. But we have not seriously thought about the public listing,” he added.\n\nAnd it appears that investors in Byju’s are also not in a hurry. “We don’t need to do public listing to give exit to some of the early investors because the business itself will generate enough cash. A good number of them have already taken the money they invested out in the last few rounds,” he said.\n\nByju’s has raised more than $700 million this year. We asked Raveendran why is the startup raising capital. “We have been very capital-efficient in terms of how we have used the primary capital we have raised. In the first five years, we have utilized less than $350 million of the primary capital — which shows how we have efficiently scaled the model,” he said.\n\n“Most of the recent fundraising is to finance inorganic growth, like full-cash acquisitions. We are utilizing it to add some strong business models. We never raised money because we needed it. It was always to add the right partner. In recent times, we have added long-term, patient investors,” he said. Byju’s is likely not done with its fundraising spree yet, as the startup is currently engaging with at least two more investment firms.\n\nFor expansion in international markets, Raveendran said it plans to launch a digital learning app aimed at kids in several English-speaking markets. He said WhiteHat Jr., will introduce math subjects to its offering to serve customers in several markets, including Australia, New Zealand.\n\nWe also talked about what he thinks of other giant startups in India that are not profitable today, the kind of message that sends to international investors and whether there is room for any new player in the education market in India, and much more.

  "title_summary": "Silver Lake leads $500 million investment round in Indian online learning giant Byju’s – TechCrunch Byju’s has raised $500 million in a new financing round that values the Indian online learning platform at $10.8 billion, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.\n\nThe round was led by Menlo Park-headquartered PE firm Silver Lake, and existing investors Tiger Global, General Atlantic and Owl Ventures have also participated in it, India’s second most valuable startup Byju’s said in a statement, but declined to reveal the size of the round and its valuation.\n\n“We are excited to welcome a strong partner like Silver Lake to the BYJU’S family,” said Byju Raveendran, co-founder and CEO of the eponymous startup in a statement. Raveendran will be appearing at Disrupt 2020 next week.\n\n“We are fortunate to be in a sector of positive relevance during this crisis. This has brought online learning to the forefront and is helping parents, teachers and students experience and understand its value. Our classrooms are changing possibly for the first time in 100 years and I’m really excited about the opportunities that we have to redefine the future of learning,” he added.\n\nByju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years it has also expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake.\n\nThe growing valuation of Byju’s comes as education startups report massive growth in their usage. Unacademy, a Facebook-backed edtech startup, nearly tripled its valuation in a span of months with its new $150 million fundraise last week. Byju’s, which was valued at $10.5 billion in June when it raised capital from Mary Meeker’s Bond (according to TechCrunch), was valued at about $5.75 billion in July last year.\n\nAs the coronavirus outbreak began to spread in India earlier this year, New Delhi enforced a nationwide lockdown that saw schools close across the nation. This has led many parents to explore digital learning services alternatives for their kids.\n\nEven as most Indians tend not to pay for online services — just ask Facebook, which has amassed over 400 million users in India and makes little in the country — the education category has become an outlier. Indian families continue to spend heavily on their children’s education in hopes of paving the way for a better future.\n\nSince the lockdown, Byju’s has added 20 million new students on its platform. Today, the app has over 64 million registered students and 4.2 million annual paid subscriptions. The startup said it has also doubled its revenue.\n\n“We are delighted to lead this investment and partner with Byju and his impressive team of education technology pioneers in their mission to help children in India and around the world achieve their true potential,” said Greg Mondre, Co-CEO of Silver Lake in a statement. Silver Lake also invested about $1.35 billion in India’s Jio Platforms earlier this year.\n\n“We look forward to working with them as BYJU’S builds on and accelerates its compelling growth trajectory by forging new partnerships and continuing to cultivate a comprehensive ecosystem of innovative educational offerings.”\n\nThere has also been some consolidation. Byju’s acquired 18-month-old WhiteHat Jr., which teaches coding to kids, for $300 million. In an interview with TechCrunch, Raveendran said the startup is raising capital in part to finance any acquisitions."

  "title_summary": "Oracle boots out Microsoft and wins bid for TikTok, reports say – TechCrunch Update: The Oracle -TikTok tie-up is confirmed as a concept. Oracle put out a release earlier today saying that is party to an agreement in which it would partner with TikTok, and that the proposal has been submitted to the US government. Here’s Oracle’s statement in full:\n\nOracle confirms Secretary Mnuchin’s statement that it is part of the proposal submitted by ByteDance to the Treasury Department over the weekend in which Oracle will serve as the trusted technology provider. Oracle has a 40-year track record providing secure, highly performant technology solutions.\n\nOriginal article: Enterprise provider Oracle is said to have won the bidding war for the U.S. operations of TikTok, a chase in which Microsoft was booted from earlier today.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said the company “[doesn’t] comment on rumors or speculation.” Oracle did not immediately respond to TechCrunch for comment.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal writes that Oracle, a rare ally of the Trump administration in Silicon Valley, will be announced as TikTok’s “trusted tech partner” in the United States. Additionally, the Journal cites that a person familiar with the matter says the deal is “likely not to be structured as an outright sale.”\n\nOracle’s alleged purchase of TikTok’s U.S. operations would put an end to the unclear fate of the app within the country. The app’s reported buy comes days before September 20, the day that the Trump administration set for a ban on TikTok’s operations if the company doesn’t reach an agreement with a buyer. But there’s much confusion about which deadline TikTok will adhere to as Trump said last week “there will be no extension” of the September 15 deadline.\n\nOn Sunday, Microsoft said its bid for the U.S. operations of TikTok has been rejected by the app’s parent company, ByteDance.\n\n“We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests,” the statement read, stating that Microsoft would make “significant changes” around security, privacy, online safety, and disinformation.\n\n“We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas,” the statement added.\n\nIssues and fears around TikTok’s security has been a flagship issue for the app. TikTok was banned in India, along with 58 other apps, due to “national security and defence” issues. India was TikTok’s biggest overseas market. In addition to Microsoft, a number of prominent tech companies have rumored to be in the market for TikTok’s U.S. operations such as Twitter, Google, and Walmart. But, as our Ron Miller pointed out, there’s some reason toward why a company like Oracle would crave an app like TikTok: marketshare.\n\nOracle has grown out of its database roots and made its way into marketing automation and cloud infrastructure. The company is not just a database maker and provider. It’s a massive operation, that monetizes off of data. Earlier in this pandemic, the enterprise data provider teamed up with Zoom. If Oracle were to bring the same kind of partnership to fruition with TikTok, it would have landed a huge client.\n\nHolger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, told TechCrunch Oracle’s scoop of TikTok “will add plenty of load to their infrastructure service.”\n\n“That’s what matters to them with viral loads preferred. If Microsoft gets TikTok it could boost their usage by between 2% and 5%, while for Oracle it could be as much 10%,” he said.\n\nOracle’s reported buy, thus, could be a boost that actually makes sense. But a dramatic one, nonetheless.\n\nIt’s uncertain how an Oracle deal will carry out or win approval from Beijing, which is clearly not happy with a forced sale. Two weeks ago, the Chinese government updated a set of trade rules that could block the export of artificial intelligence technologies such as those used to personalize TikTok’s user feeds. The revision is widely viewed as Beijing’s move to complicate TikTok’s sale and ByteDance said at the time it will “strictly abide by” the law.\n\nOver the weekend, Reuters reported that Beijing would rather see TikTok close down in the U.S. rather than following Washington’s order to sell, which would “make both ByteDance and China appear weak in the face of pressure from Washington.”\n\nSome form of transaction may still happen, but it might leave out TikTok’s proprietary algorithms developed by ByteDance’s Beijing office, a source told the South China Morning Post. That means TikTok’s U.S. operations or future owner would have to rewrite the very codes that have propelled the app to global domination.\n\nAfter all, Oracle might end up as a minority stakeholder rather than an owner of TikTok, according to CNBC. An investment tie might just be strong enough to bind Oracle’s cloud services to TikTok, which has over 100 million users in the U.S. market alone.\n\nWhether a sale happens or not, getting caught in geopolitical tensions is probably the last thing that Zhang Yiming, the ambitious Chinese founder of ByteDance, would want for his brainchild."

By the end of the year, Uber Green will be available in over 65 cities around the world. Riders who choose the green option will also receive three times the Uber Rewards points they would have received for a typical UberX ride, the company said.\n\nUber’s second step toward making the world a greener place is to commit $800 million to transition its fleet to electric vehicles. Part of that transition is being subsidized by the $1 surcharge for riders who choose to go green and from fees that the company collects under its London and French Clean Air Plans. Those are 15 cent (or pence) surcharges that Uber has been collecting since January of last year to pay for the electrification of its drivers’ cars in European cities.\n\nTo incentivize drivers to go green, Uber’s doling out an extra 50 cents per trip in the U.S. and Canada for every “Uber Green” trip completed to be paid out by riders. Drivers using EVs will also get another dollar from Uber itself, amounting to $1.50 more per trip for each EV ride completed.\n\nOther enticements include partnerships with GM in the U.S. and Canada and Renault -Nissan in Europe to offer discounts on electric vehicles to Uber drivers. Working with Avis, Uber is planning to offer more electric vehicles for rental to U.S. drivers. Meanwhile, the company said it would also expand electric vehicle charging by working to develop new charging stations in conjunction with companies like BP, EVgo, Enel X, Izivia by EDF and PowerDot.\n\nUber’s also working to revive the vision of robotic battery swapping to enable customers to forget about their concerns when it comes to charging a new vehicle. It’s working with the San Francisco-based startup Ample, as the young company develops its battery-swapping tech — and Lithium Urban Technologies, an electric fleet operator out of India.\n\nBuilding on its existing micromobility network, the company is going to integrate bikes and scooters from Lime even closer into its networks and expanding its shared ride programs as soon as it’s safe to do it. The company is also intent on expanding its Journey Planning feature to enable users to see pricing options, schedules and directions to and from transit stations. Uber also now offers in-app ticketing in more than 10 cities, so people can buy public transit passes in the app itself. As a coup de grace, Uber’s also unveiling a new feature that allows users to plan their trips in Chicago and Sydney using cars and public transit to get where they need to go.\n\nFinally, the company has released its first Climate Assessment and Performance Report analyzing emissions from the company’s operations in the United States and Canada from 2017 through 2019. Unsurprisingly, Uber found that it was more efficient than single-occupant driving, but the company did reveal that its carbon intensity is higher than that of average-occupancy personal cars. Meaning when there’re two people using a personal car, their footprint is lower than that of an Uber driver looking for passengers.\n\nAlthough arguably, Uber shouldn’t be having its customers foot so much of the bill for its electric transition, these are all positive steps from a company that still has a long road ahead of it if it’s looking to reduce its carbon footprint."

  "title_summary": "China may kill TikTok’s US operations rather than see them sold – TechCrunch The controversial push to force Chinese tech unicorn ByteDance to divest part or all of its smash-hit TikTok social media service to a U.S.-based company could be in doubt after a report today indicated that China’s government may oppose the transaction. According to reporting by Reuters, the Chinese government may prefer TikTok to simply shutter its U.S. operations instead of allowing it to be sold to an American company.\n\nThe potential divestment of TikTok is not a regular business transaction. Instead, the deal is being demanded by the U.S. government, as President Donald Trump directs foreign and economic policymaking via executive fiat. Leaning on his own fabled business acumen, the American premier has also demanded that his government receive a portion of any final sale price. It is not clear if that concept is legal.\n\nAs the U.S. and China spar around the globe for both economic and political supremacy, the deal is a flashpoint between the countries with a muddle of companies stuck in the middle. ByteDance is in the mix, along with Microsoft, Walmart and other companies to a lesser degree, like Oracle. The Trump administration has set a mid-September timeline for a deal being struck, though as the month burns away it is not clear if that timeline could be met.\n\nThe United States is not alone in taking steps to curb Chinese influence inside its borders, as the TikTok sale comes after India banned the app, along with dozens of other China-based applications.\n\nThe deal is also under pressure from a changing regulatory environment in China, with the country’s autocratic leadership changing its export rules to possibly include elements of TikTok that could limit a transaction, and perhaps scuttle its sale.\n\nFor ByteDance, the situation is a nightmare. For lead-suitor Microsoft, the transaction is a shotgun marriage that it might not be entirely enthused about. For the Trump administration, it’s an attempt at a power play. And for China’s increasingly authoritarian government, the deal could feel like submission. So, if the deal does manage to come together it will be more surprise than eventuality."

  "title_summary": "Google’s new ‘Verified Calls’ feature will tell you why a business is calling you – TechCrunch Google’s new ‘Verified Calls’ feature will tell you why a business is calling you\n\nGoogle today is introducing a new feature for Android phones that will help legitimate businesses reach their customers by phone by having their brand name and reason for calling properly identified. The feature, known as “Verified Calls,” will display the caller’s name, their logo, a reason why they’re calling and a verification symbol that will indicate the call has been verified by Google.\n\nThe feature arrives at a time when spam calls are on the rise. U.S. consumers received 61.4 billion spam calls in 2019, according to a recent report from RoboKiller, representing a 28% increase from the prior year. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission also says that unwanted calls are its top consumer complaint.\n\nGoogle’s new system gives legitimate businesses a way to share their information with consumers, along with their reason for calling on the incoming call screen. This, however, only works with those participating businesses who have chosen to sign up with one of Google’s partners in order to have their calls verified.\n\nAccording to Google’s website for the service, businesses can get started with Verified Calls by working with a partner such as Neustar, JustCall, Telecall, Zenvia, Prestus, Aspect, Five9, Vonage, Bandwidth, IMImobile, Kaleyra, Quiubas Mobile or Datora.\n\nOnce set up, a business will send Google’s Verified Calls server its number, the customer’s phone number and the call reason, like “scheduling your internet installation,” or “your food delivery,” for example. Google then sends this information to the Android device’s Google Phone app. The device compares the incoming call information with the information Google received from the business and, if there’s a match, the Phone app displays the call as “Verified.” Google says the customer phone number and call reason is deleted within minutes of verification to protect consumer privacy.\n\nThe feature is enabled by default in the Google Phone app for Android devices, which comes pre-loaded on many Android phones and will be available for download for more Android devices later this week. At launch, it will work on select Android Pie and higher devices, including many flagship Samsung and LG devices.\n\nGoogle says it pilot tested the new feature for a few months before going live and found that verification did increase the chances of someone answering a call. It did not share the specific results.\n\nHowever, Google’s existing Verified SMS system for text messages has been adopted by a number of brands, including 1-800-Flowers, Banco Bradesco, Kayak, Payback and SoFi, for example. Google claims a study in the U.S. and Brazil found that Verified SMS increased customer trust in brands, and improved metrics like likelihood to purchase, brand satisfaction and likelihood to recommend.\n\nVerified Calls is launching first in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Spain and India, with more countries to follow.\n\nGoogle already offers a way for consumers to fight incoming spam with its Google Assistant feature, Call Screen. This feature allows the Google Assistant to answer the call on the user’s behalf, then ask them who’s calling and why. A transcript is sent to the phone’s owner, who can then choose to send a suggested response, pick up or hang up.\n\nBut Call Screen works automatically in English in the U.S., and can be used manually in Canada, according to Google’s Help documentation. Verified Calls, meanwhile, is offered in more countries worldwide and leverages industry partnerships to work, instead of AI, making it a broader solution."

  "title_summary": "TikTok hits 100M users in Europe as the clock ticks on its US business – TechCrunch TikTok may or may not be making a deal for its U.S. operations, which the U.S. government says it will shut down over national security concerns come September 20th if its Chinese ownership is not resolved. But something that the U.S. narrative has not really addressed is that the company is still growing like a weed in other markets. Today, TikTok announced that it had hit the 100 million month active user milestone in Europe, where it has officially launched in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Russia and Spain.\n\n“We’ve been humbled to see how Europe has embraced TikTok during the time we’ve been here,” said Rich Waterworth, the company’s head of Europe, in a blog post today. He also added that the Creator Fund for Europe, launched earlier this month with TikTok committing to pay out €250 million over the next three years to professional “creators” trying to make money producing video content for the app, has seen more than 40% of all eligible creators enrolling.\n\nNotably, TikTok is putting this news out less than one month after it said it had reached 100 million users in the U.S.\n\nThe news comes at an interesting time for the company in other ways too.\n\nIt points to a kind of scale in the region that stands to become even more important for TikTok’s owner ByteDance, and specifically as a counter-balance to its future prospects in its biggest two markets. ByteDance is not only facing some tough times ahead in the U.S., but it’s also weathering some significant storms in its second-largest market, India, where the app has been banned and seems currently to have no prospective buyers or champions to get it out of that predicament.\n\nCurrently in the U.S., the company seems to have three options: the U.S. might be shut down altogether; or TikTok sells the business to another company in whole or part and relinquishes making money or using U.S. creators and audience to fuel its viral video machine; or ByteDance somehow manages to take the Trump administration to court and win to keep things operating as is or with some modifications.\n\nAll three are very painful in their own ways, making the growth and potential in Europe even more notable.\n\nTikTok has been trying to take a “business as usual” approach to things despite all of this. In recent weeks, it has launched a number of new features both for consumers and for marketers in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nThey have included an expansion of its marketing tools, to expand the variety and size of advertisers who use the platform to promote their brands, and new features like Stitch, which gives a way for users to sample content from other videos and then “quoting” and sharing among users on the platform, as well as adding in new ways to post more and creating more viral videos.\n\nThe numbers also underscore an early thought experiment: What would TikTok life be like without input from the U.S. market?\n\nSo far, it’s fair to say that the U.S. TikTok explosion has been a major part of the global TikTok explosion. It has produced not just the biggest audience, but the app’s biggest stars. And if you take Facebook or any other social app as a benchmark, the U.S. would stand to become TikTok’s biggest market for advertisers and revenues over time, too.\n\nStill, it’s very notable that the 100 million milestone in Europe was put out today of all days. In the last 24 hours, we’ve seen conflicting reports about a possible buyer — Oracle — finally nearing a deal; as well as a separate report that the Chinese government is ready to shut down the whole process.\n\nPutting out the European numbers so close timing-wise — less than three weeks apart — to posting about 100 million users in the U.S. could be ByteDance’s way of saying that it might just have the last dance after all."

  "title_summary": "LanzaTech eyes two more spin-off companies – TechCrunch Just three months after LanzaTech announced a spin-out aimed at selling sustainable aviation fuel, the company is already preparing for two more.\n\nLanzaTech CEO Jennifer Holmgren said Tuesday on the Disrupt 2020 virtual stage that the carbon capture technology company is planning to use its core technology to create two other businesses.\n\nLanzaTech captures waste gas emissions and uses bacteria to turn it into useable ethanol fuel. A bioreactor is used to convert into liquids captured and compressed waste emissions from a steel mill or factory or any other emissions-producing enterprises.\n\nThe core technology of LanzaTech — and its future businesses — is a bacteria that likes to eat these dirty gas streams. As the bacteria eats the emissions it essentially ferments them — a bit like how beer is made, Holmgren recently explained — and emits ethanol. The ethanol can then be turned into various products.\n\n“Using a technology like ours that can use so many different feedstocks — waste biomass, industrial gases, CO2 from the air — you’re going to be making so much ethanol, that I think of ethanol as the feedstock of the future. In other words, you’re going to use ethanol to make other products.”\n\nIn June, LanzaTech did just that and announced a spin-off called LanzaJet. The new company launched with commitments from Japanese trading and investment company Mitsui & Co. and Canadian oil and gas producer Suncor Energy, which will invest $85 million to fund pilot and development-scale facilities for LanzaJet.\n\nNow it seems that LanzaTech has plans to pursue other pieces of the supply chain. Holmgren said the company is focused on a couple of use cases on the chemical side. Ethanol, for instance, can be converted to ethylene, which is used to make polyethylene for bottles and PEP for fibers used to make clothes.\n\n“We see a path from ethanol to products using today’s supply chain,” Holmgren said.\n\nMore importantly, LanzaTech has focused on synthetic biology. The company has learned to modify the bacteria that it already uses to make ethanol, and instead harnesses it to make other chemicals directly.\n\n“So you can imagine someday, we’re not just gonna make a fuel for a plane, we’re going make the seatbelts and upholstery — all of these things through synthetic biology,” she said, adding that this will likely become a spin-off.\n\nThe second spin-off company focuses on a byproduct it already makes. The bacteria that eats carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide is a “skinny bacteria” as Holmgren calls it, because it is mostly protein. LanzaTech already sells this skinny bacteria as a co-product of its technology.\n\n“Not in the too distant future we will want to run a reactor with all of these gases, not to make ethanol, but to make protein, and I see that as an ultimate spin-out as well,” she said.\n\nHolmgren didn’t provide a specific timeline of these spin-outs. Although she added that the company is putting together a plan now and will begin to make some moves in the next three months. There is capital that will be needed to get these enterprises up and running. The synthetic biology spin-off, which Holmgren said is further along, will need a couple hundred million dollars up front.\n\nHolmgren also announced Tuesday during Disrupt 2020 a new small-scale waste biomass gasifier in India. The new gasifier will be hosted at Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemical, one of India’s largest refiners. The LanzaTech gasifier, which will be built in partnership with Indian project development firm Ankur Scientific, will use waste to make ethanol and chemicals rather than power."

  "title_summary": "N95 masks could soon be rechargeable instead of disposable – TechCrunch The pandemic has led to N95 masks quickly becoming one of the world’s most sought-after resources as essential workers burned through billions of them. New research could lead to an N95 that you can recharge rather than throw away — or even one that continuously tops itself up for maximum effectiveness.\n\nThe proposed system, from researchers at Technion-IIT in Israel and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in India, is not one of decontamination, as you might expect. Instead, it focuses on another aspect of N95 masks that renders them less effective over time.\n\nN95s use both mechanical filtering, in which particles are caught in a matrix of microscopic fibers, and electrostatic filtering, in which particles are attracted to surfaces that carry a static charge. It’s like the old trick where you rub a balloon on your head and it sticks — but at the scale of microns.\n\nThe combination of these two methods makes N95 masks very effective, but the electrostatic charge, like any charge, dissipates after time as air and moisture pass over it. While decontamination via UV or high temperature may help keep the mechanical filter from becoming a tiny petri dish, they do nothing to restore the electrostatic charge that acted as a second barrier to entry.\n\nIn a paper published in the journal Physics of Fluids, Dov Levine and Shankar Ghosh (from Technion and Tata, respectively) show that it’s possible to recharge an N95’s filter to the point where it was close to off-the-shelf levels of efficacy. All that’s needed is to place the filter between two plate electrodes and apply a strong electric field.\n\n“We find that the total charge deposited on the masks depends strongly on the charging time… with the pristine value almost reattained after a 60 min charge at 1000 V,” write the researchers in their paper.\n\nIt’s unlikely that healthcare workers are going to be disassembling their masks after every shift, though. While a service and special mask type could (and if it’s effective, should) be established to do this, the team also explored the possibility of a mask with a built-in battery that recharges itself constantly:\n\nA solution that can help replenish the lost charge on the masks in real time would be desirable. In this section, we provide a proof-of-concept method of keeping the masks charged, which comes as a logical extension of our recharging method. We tested a technique by which the filter material maintains its charge and thus its filtration efficiency… Since the currents required are extremely small, a large battery is not required, and it is possible that a small compact and practical solution may be feasible.\n\nThe image above shows a prototype, which the team found to work quite well.\n\nOf course it’s not quite ready for deployment; IEEE Spectrum asked Peter Tsai, the creator of the N95 mask, for his opinion on it. He suggested that the team’s method for testing filtration efficacy is “likely questionable” but didn’t take issue with the rest of the study.\n\nThough it won’t be in hospitals tomorrow or next week, the team notes that “crucially, our method can be performed using readily available equipment and materials and so can be employed both in urban and rural settings.” So once it’s thoroughly tested it’s possible these rechargeable masks could start showing up everywhere. Let’s hope so."

Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.\n\nHow one VC firm wound up with no-code startups as part of its investing thesis\n\nThroughout all the chaos of 2020’s economic upheaval in the startup world, I’ve worked to pay more attention to low-code and no-code services. The short gist of chats I’ve had with investors and founders and public company execs in the past few weeks is that market awareness of no-code/low-code terminology is starting to spread more broadly.\n\nWhy? Again, summarizing aggressively, it seems that the gap between what different business units need (marketing, say) and what in-house or external engineering teams are capable of providing is widening. This means there is more total pain in the market, hunting for a solution, often with a tooling budget in hand.\n\nEnter no-code and low-code startups, and even big-company services alike that can help non-developers do more without having to beg for engineering inputs.\n\nI spoke with Arun Mathew this week. He’s a partner at Accel, a venture firm that has invested in all sorts of companies that you’ve heard of — including Webflow, which raised a $72 million Series A last August that Mathew led for his firm. (More on the round here, and notes from TechCrunch on Webflow’s early days here, and here, if you are curious.)\n\nMore interesting than that single round is how Accel wound up building a thesis around no-code startups. According to Mathew, Accel had made large investments into companies like Qualtrics, for example, when they were already pretty big and had found product-market fit. That same general approach led to the Webflow deal last year.\n\nAt the time, Webflow “wasn’t really defining what they were doing as n- code, they just said ‘we have a very simple drag and drop UI, to build websites, and soon full web applications, very simply,’ ” he told TechCrunch. But, according to Mathew, what Webflow was doing “lined up really well” with the “rising movement of no-code.”\n\nFrom there, Accel “made a couple [more no-code] investments in Europe where [it has] an early-stage team and a growth team,” along with a few more in India. In the investor’s view, some of the investing activity was “thesis driven because we think [no-code is] a really interesting theme,” but some of the deals “happened opportunistically” where Accel had found “really talented founders in the space that we thought was interesting, executing on a vision that we found appealing.”\n\nIn the “span of a year, year-and-a-half,” Accel totted up “seven or eight companies in this no-code space,” which over the last five or six quarters became “a real thesis” for the firm, Mathew said. Accel now has “a global team” of around a dozen people “spending a lot of our time in and around no-code” he added.\n\nApologies for the length there, but what Mathew said makes me feel a bit less behind. After dipping a toe into learning more about no-code services and tooling (and, yes, low-code as well) it felt somewhat like I was playing catch-up. But as I covered that Webflow round and have since started paying more attention to no-code as well, perhaps you and I are right on time.\n\n(We also recently ran an investor survey on the no-code topic, so hit it up if you want more VC scribbles on the topic.)\n\nMarket Notes\n\nFor Market Notes this week, we have four things. First, riffs from chats with two public company execs about the software market, some public market stuff and then some neat Airbnb spend data by which I am confounded:\n\nI spoke with Apple MDM company Jamf’s CFO Jill Putman this week, after her company reported its first set of earnings as a public company. I wanted to know a bit more about the education market — a hot topic here at TechCrunch, given outsized rounds and huge market demand — and the medical world.\n\nRegarding the software market for education, Putman noted that schools are buying lots of hardware, and that software sales should follow. Our read from that is that the boom in education software is not going to slow for some time as schools work on reopening.\n\nDitto the medical market, where Jamf has found uptake as hospitals roll out hardware to patients and families thereof to facilitate all sorts of demand that COVID has engendered. (Hardware needs software, enter Jamf!)\n\nChatting with the CFO our key takeaway was that there are still sectors that could generate a continued COVID tailwind, even if not all Jamf customers fit that bill. For startups that did catch a wave, this is probably good news.\n\nAnd then there was Yext, a company that helps other companies’ customers find accurate information about them around the Web, and has recently gotten into the search game. Yext launched at a TechCrunch conference back in 2009, which is a neat bit of history. Anyway, Yext is public company now and we wanted to chat about which industries are driving growth for the former startup, and how the general climate for software is for the company, so we got on Zoom with its CEO, Howard Lerman.\n\nSo, which sectors are accelerating from Yext’s perspective? Government, education (again), insurance and financial services. Let that guide your take on the health of various startups.\n\nTurning to the business climate, Lerman had some notes: “I will tell you in Q2,” he said, “things came back a bit from Q1.” In what sense? Retention rates, for one, according to the CEO. A return to form is welcome, but Lerman did caution that some companies were slower to “pull the trigger on big deals.”\n\nLerman also said that his perspective on the macro-climate has bounced back as well from a local-minima set around 30 days ago.\n\nPublic company execs are pretty guarded in how they talk because they have to be. But what Putman and Lerman seemed to intimate is that economic damage — provided you are selling to business, and not individuals — seems more contained on a per-sector basis than I would have anticipated. And that there are some good things ahead, at least in a handful of hot sectors.\n\nOpening our aperture a bit, some SaaS companies struggled this week to meet investor expectations, even as more companies added themselves to the IPO queue. It’s going to be very busy for a few quarters. (Speaking of which, you can find the good and bad from the new Sumo IPO filing here.)\n\nThe economy is still garbage for many, but at least for companies it’s improving. And on that note, some data regarding Airbnb. According to the folks over at Edison Trends, things are going better for the home-booking site than I would have guessed. Per the group:\n\nAirbnb’s bookings recovery outstripped its traditional rivals, growing “32% week-over-week” from late April into early June.\n\nAnd, most critically: “Airbnb spending in July was up 22% over the previous July, and spending the week of August 17 was 75% higher than the equivalent week in 2019.”\n\nWild, right? Perhaps that’s why Airbnb has filed to go public.\n\nVarious and Sundry\n\nWe’re a tiny bit short on space, so I’ll keep our V&S dose short this week to respect your time. Here’s what I couldn’t not share:\n\nAnd with that, we are out of room. Hugs, fist bumps and good vibes, and thank you so much for reading this little newsletter on the weekends. It’s a treat to write, and I hope you like it.\n\nHit me up with notes at alex.wilhelm@techcrunch.com. (I don’t know if you reply to this email if I will get the response. But try it so that we can find out?)\n\nAlex"

  "title_summary": "Pearls Are a Boy’s Best Friend It was on the pink carpet of the 2019 Met Gala that Harry Styles helped reintroduce men to the mollusk. The English former boy-bander, an event co-chair, wore a vaguely Grecian look created for him by the Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele that included a sheer black blouse with a ruffle front and pussy bow, high high-waisted pants, patent-leather heeled boots and a single, perfect pearl earring that owed as much to the theme of the evening — camp — as it did to Rembrandt’s paintings of 17th-century Dutch noblemen (and, yes, Vermeer’s). Since then, Styles, 26, has graduated to wearing a string of pearls around his neck, which he has typically paired with boyish tops: a checkered Marni polo; a Lanvin cardigan featuring Babar the Elephant; an acid-green crew-neck sweater by Magda Archer in collaboration with Marc Jacobs, fellow pearl-necklace enthusiast.\n\nThe history of men in pearl necklaces — a perilous internet search, if ever there was one — can be traced to the early 16th century, during the Mughal Empire in India, when long strands could be seen on the emperor Babur and his male descendants. In Europe, Henry VIII wore clothes embroidered with them during his reign as the king of England in the first half of the 1500s. A mourning costume presented to Captain Cook in 1774 during one of his voyages to Tahiti featured a mask and breastplate made of mother-of-pearl. For each of them, ornamentation suggested clout; in that way, pearls predicted a cowboy’s custom belt buckle, a Hollywood actor’s private jet, the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.’s fleet of Rolls-Royces."

  "title_summary": "Finding a Place for Third-Culture Kids in the Culture Others have found freedom in the same, becoming natural shape-shifters whose value systems transcend borders to instill a sense of home. The most famous example is probably Barack Obama, whose 1995 memoir, “Dreams From My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance,” whirls through Jakarta, Seattle, Kenya and Hawaii with unsparing analysis of what it means to belong to multiple worlds and therefore to none of them, but to find, later, that refuge lies in the space between all of them — and in the ability to unite not just your worlds but others’, too. As much as the third-culture experience is clouded by the fog of liminality, it’s informed also by the ability to define oneself on one’s own terms, difficult as that endeavor may be in the face of increasing scrutiny toward globalism and those formed by it.\n\nThe presentation of this — dazzling and dressed up — is what makes “We Are Who We Are” thrilling to watch. Its characters come alive in the blur, filling in one another’s spaces and dancing over questions of home, while bragging about where they’ve been, their exchanges captured in shimmering, slow-motion interludes scored to original music, the silky synth pop of Blood Orange. And while the show takes place in the run-up to the 2016 election, its politics remain a quiet drumbeat in the offing, its spotlight focused wholly on all the ways by which differences are, in fact, paradoxically harmonious when everyone is otherized. In fashioning themselves to evade traditional modes of identification (culturally, politically, sexually and through gender), these characters build their own castles in the sky. “When you grow up this way, there is a feeling of being lost, but to be lost is also to be open,” Guadagnino says. “It reminds us of our empathy, and of what we share if we were only to try and find it.”\n\nThis may be the ultimate lesson of third-culture kids’ stories. In the late Kobe Bryant’s 2018 book “The Mamba Mentality,” which offers a glimpse into his childhood years in Reggio Emilia, Italy, he discusses the importance of having learned how to navigate a new culture with compassion. Though he eventually settled down in America — becoming not only one of its sports heroes, but one of its cultural icons, too — he continued to make frequent trips back to Italy, where he’d speak the sort of Italian that boasted a native European bravado, a casual swagger that rode along his perfect pronunciation. And when he died in Los Angeles, he died in Reggio Emilia, too, where they mourned a version of him America never knew, except for the Italian names he had chosen for his daughters: Gianna, Natalia, Bianka and Capri."

Triller's App Store downloads skyrocketed after India banned TikTok on Jun. 29 following ongoing border disputes with China.\n\nThe Trump administration has expressed concern over TikTok's security, since the app is owned and operated by the Chinese company ByteDance. Trump first floated banning the app in July as retaliation against China for their supposed involvement in spreading the coronavirus. Days later, Trump reneged , and claimed he would allow the app's continued availability in the United States as long as it's bought by a \"very American\" company and if the U.S. government could get an unprecedented cut of the deal.\n\nTrump followed that with an executive order banning TikTok and WeChat, a messaging app owned by Chinese company Tencent, from American app stores if they weren't sold to American companies within 45 days. TikTok, in return, filed a lawsuit on Aug. 24 against the Trump administration \"to protect our rights, and the rights of our community and employees.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft and Oracle were both bidding to buy TikTok. Oracle won the bid, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. There's a catch, though — the deal will not be structured as a sale. Rather, Oracle will be TikTok's \"trusted tech partner\" in the U.S., and will take over TikTok's operations in the States. The deal is pending approval from the White House and the Committee on Foreign Investment.\n\nOracle has ties to the Trump Administration. Its executives are \"political allies of the president,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nAmid all of the uncertainty surrounding TikTok, its most popular creators are quietly migrating to Triller. The D'Amelio family — Charli, her sister Dixie, their mother Heidi, and their father Marc — made their debuts this week.\n\n\"We couldn't be more proud to welcome the D'Amelio family to the Triller family with open arms,\" Triller's executive chairman Bobby Sarnevesht said in a statement to Verge. \"They are an incredibly multi-faceted and talented family who have already been invaluable to us.\"\n\nTriller reports it has 65 million monthly users, and it saw a surge of downloads following Trump's threat to ban TikTok. It also threatened to sue reports questioning whether its self-reported numbers are inflated."

  "title_summary": "Google supports COVID-19 AI and data analytics projects Nonprofits, universities and other academic institutions around the world are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics to help us better understand COVID-19 and its impact on communities—especially vulnerable populations and healthcare workers. To support this work, Google.org is giving more than $8.5 million to 31 organizations around the world to aid in COVID-19 response. Three of these organizations will also receive the pro-bono support of Google.org Fellowship teams.\n\nThis funding is part of Google.org’s $100 million commitment to COVID-19 relief and focuses on four key areas where new information and action is needed to help mitigate the effects of the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring and forecasting disease spread\n\nUnderstanding the spread of COVID-19 is critical to informing public health decisions and lessening its impact on communities. We’re supporting the development of data platforms to help model disease and projects that explore the use of diverse public datasets to more accurately predict the spread of the virus.\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving health equity and minimizing secondary effects of the pandemic\n\nCOVID-19 has had a disproportionate effect on vulnerable populations. To address health disparities and drive equitable outcomes, we’re supporting efforts to map the social and environmental drivers of COVID-19 impact, such as race, ethnicity, gender and socioeconomic status. In addition to learning more about the immediate health effects of COVID-19, we’re also supporting work that seeks to better understand and reduce the long-term, indirect effects of the virus—ranging from challenges with mental health to delays in preventive care.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlowing transmission by advancing the science of contact tracing and environmental sensing\n\nContact tracing is a valuable tool to slow the spread of disease. Public health officials around the world are using digital tools to help with contact tracing. Google.org is supporting projects that advance science in this important area, including research investigating how to improve exposure risk assessments while preserving privacy and security. We’re also supporting related research to understand how COVID-19 might spread in public spaces, like transit systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporting healthcare workers\n\nWhether it’s working to meet the increased demand for acute patient care, adapting to rapidly changing protocols or navigating personal mental and physical wellbeing, healthcare workers face complex challenges on the frontlines. We’re supporting organizations that are focused on helping healthcare workers quickly adopt new protocols, deliver more efficient care, and better serve vulnerable populations.\n\n\n\nTogether, these organizations are helping make the community’s response to the pandemic more advanced and inclusive, and we’re proud to support these efforts.

REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri/File photo\n\nWhile the government has eased lockdown restrictions to revive the economy, supply distortions remain due to coronavirus cases rising domestically at the fastest pace in the world.\n\nThe Sept. 4-9 Reuters poll of nearly 50 economists suggested consumer prices rose 6.85% last month from a year ago.\n\nWhile that is slightly lower than the 6.93% surge in July, if realised it would mean inflation was above the central bank’s target range of 2-6% for a fifth straight month - something not seen since August 2014.\n\n“Supply side disruptions have led to an increase in food prices, especially vegetables. Moreover, some pent-up demand supported core inflation along with high gold prices and an increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel that have second round effects,” said Sakshi Gupta, senior economist at HDFC Bank.\n\nGood monsoon rains - a key factor for agricultural produce and rural demand in India - raised hopes of some easing in the rise in food costs but a meaningful decline may be a distant possibility as transportation remains a major concern as the virus is still spreading rapidly.\n\nThat gives little room for further monetary policy easing despite official data showing Asia’s third-largest economy contracted a record 23.9% last quarter and expectations for a first full-year contraction in four decades.\n\nStill, the RBI - which has slashed its key repo rate by a cumulative 115 basis points since the pandemic began - kept rates on hold last month on concerns over rising price pressures.\n\n“We think the trajectory of inflation suggests a very high likelihood the monetary policy committee will remain on hold in the next two meetings with the final rate cut possible in February 2021,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA.\n\nThe poll also forecast industrial output plunged 11.5% in July - marking a fourth straight month of decline.\n\nThose expectations came after a near 10% fall from a year ago in the output of eight core industries, or infrastructure output, which accounts for about 40% of total industrial production."

  "title_summary": "Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death grips India with frenzied TV coverage MUMBAI (Reuters) - The demise of a young movie star has transfixed India like no other news in a year of bad headlines.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Actor Sushant Singh talks to the media on the green carpet at the International Indian Film Academy Rocks show at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, U.S., July 14, 2017. REUTERS/Joe Penney/File Photo\n\nThe abrupt death of Sushant Singh Rajput has spurred a debate about the stigma of mental health, the rarefied insider world of Bollywood, and, more recently, condemnation of the media for the non-stop coverage of the duelling accusations between Rajput’s family and his girlfriend.\n\nMumbai police initially reported Rajput’s death as accidental and local media called it a suicide. But the federal police agency is now investigating if there was any foul play and is questioning Rajput’s girlfriend, Rhea Chakraborty, and others.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chakraborty was arrested by India’s narcotics department, which is investigating a drugs case linked to the probe of Rajput’s death. She denies any wrongdoing and her lawyer, Satish Maneshinde, called the arrest “a travesty of justice”.\n\nAlong the way, the story has become a media obsession in India, fed by a wave of TV coverage still swelling almost three months after Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Mumbai apartment.\n\nIn recent weeks, India’s TV channels have given more airtime to the Rajput case than India’s surging COVID-19 caseload, a plane crash and top political stories, according to the Broadcast Audience Research Council.\n\nIndia’s boisterous TV networks, which include more than 350 news channels in English and several local languages, have flashed photos of Rajput’s body, analysed his medical prescriptions, even used voodoo dolls and graphics of a skull to hype allegations that “black magic” was performed on the actor.\n\nThe federal police, the High Court in Mumbai, and the government watchdog Press Council of India have all criticised coverage of the investigation.\n\n“I spent 21 years in television and I’ve never seen a race to the bottom this bad,” said Nidhi Razdan, who recently left Indian news network NDTV to teach journalism.\n\n“It is a media trial. What else is it?” she said. “I haven’t seen this kind of viciousness in coverage before.”\n\n‘SICKENING’\n\nBefore his June 14 death, Rajput, most famous for portraying India’s cricket captain in a biopic, and his girlfriend were more likely to be depicted as a down-to-earth - if Bollywood-beautiful - couple, cuddling tousled-haired at home or sitting playfully in jeans on a rundown park bench.\n\nChakraborty, 28, was regularly hounded by reporters when she appeared in public, with news commentators opining on her innocence or guilt.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nRajput’s family claims she poisoned him, used black magic and is responsible for his death.\n\n“There has been a conspiracy to break me and my family and my spirit,” Chakraborty said in an interview with television anchor Rajdeep Sardesai in late August. “It is the systematic breakdown of an innocent family, an innocent girl who loved an innocent boy.”\n\nOn Sunday, she was jostled by a pack of journalists as she tried to enter a narcotics department office in Mumbai, where police struggled to disperse the crowd.\n\n“Sickening,” journalist Swati Chaturvedi wrote on Twitter. Alaka Sahani, a senior Indian Express journalist, said, “The visuals of Rhea being hounded makes my stomach churn and puke.”\n\nThe CBI, the federal police agency, said last month it was investigating allegations of abetment to suicide and criminal conspiracy. Its announcement came after requests from Rajput’s family and Chakraborty.\n\nIn a statement last week, the CBI said some media reports on its probe were “speculative” and “not credible.” The bureau, it said, “has not shared any details of investigation with media.”\n\nThe Press Council of India has urged the media not to “conduct its own parallel trial.”\n\nSome television editors have defended the coverage.\n\nArnab Goswami, editor of Republic TV and a widely watched anchor known for his sharp-elbowed commentary, last week credited his channel’s coverage with ensuring that Rajput’s death wasn’t “whitewashed” as a suicide.\n\n“I pushed, I pressurised, I connected the dots,” he told news website OpIndia. “In the process, if I’ve done a media trial, I’m happy I have done one.”\n\nGoswami did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. His main show, The Debate, ran last week with the hashtag #ArrestRheaNext.\n\nSoon after her arrest on Tuesday, the channel started using the tag #RheaArrested."

  "title_summary": "India says China laying cables to bolster communications at border flashpoint LEH, India (Reuters) - Two Indian officials said Chinese troops were laying a network of fibre optic cables at a western Himalayan flashpoint with India, suggesting they were digging in for the long haul despite high-level talks aimed at resolving a standoff there.\n\nRiver Indus flows through Leh, in the Ladakh region, September 14, 2020. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\n\nSuch cables, which would provide forward troops with secure lines of communication to bases in the rear, have recently been spotted to the south of Pangong Tso lake in the Himalayan region of Ladakh, a senior government official said.\n\nThousands of Indian and Chinese troops backed by tanks and aircraft are locked in an uneasy stalemate along a 70 km-long front to the south of the lake.\n\nThe two sides have accused each other of escalating the most serious confrontation on the border between the nuclear-armed neighbours in decades.\n\nA third Indian official said on Monday that there had been no significant withdrawals or reinforcements on either side since the foreign ministers of the two countries met last week.\n\n“It is as tense as earlier,” he said.\n\nA spokesman for China’s foreign ministry cast doubt on the report of the cable network.\n\n“As far as I know, the relevant report is not true,” the spokesman, Wang Wenbin, said when asked on Tuesday.\n\nChina and India would remain in communication through diplomatic and military channels, the ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin, told a news briefing in Beijing.\n\nChinese defence officials could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIn June, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in hand-to-hand fighting with Chinese troops in the area. Both sides had agreed to pull back after that clash, but the Indian army has accused Chinese forces of violating that accord\n\nSECURE COMMUNICATIONS\n\nAbove Leh, Ladakh’s main city, Indian fighter planes flew throughout the morning on Monday, their engines booming and echoing across the valley surrounded by brown, barren mountains.\n\n“Our biggest worry is that they have laid optical fibre cables for high-speed communications,” the first official said, referring to the lake’s southern bank, where Indian and Chinese troops are only a few hundred metres apart at some points.\n\n“They have been laying optical fibre cables on the southern bank at breakneck speed,” he said.\n\nIndian intelligence agencies noted similar cables to the north of the Pangong Tso lake about a month ago, the second government official said.\n\nThe first Indian official said authorities were alerted to the activity when satellite imagery showed unusual lines in the sand of the high-altitude deserts to the south of Pangong Tso.\n\nThe lines were judged by Indian experts - and corroborated by foreign intelligence agencies - to be communication cables laid in trenches, he said, including near the Spanggur gap, among hilltops where soldiers fired in the air recently for the first time in decades.\n\nIndian officials say a build-up in border infrastructure on their side is also likely to have played a part in the confrontation.\n\nThe Chinese have complained about India building roads and air strips in the area and Beijing says this triggered the tension.\n\nA former Indian military intelligence official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said fibre optic cables offered communications security as well as the ability to send data such as pictures and documents.\n\n“If you speak on radio, it can get caught. Communications on optical fibre cables is secure,” he said.\n\nThe Indian military still depends on radio communications, the first official said, although he said it was encrypted."

But the growth in infections in India is faster than anywhere else in the world, as cases surge through urban and rural areas.\n\nThe western state of Maharashtra has been particularly hard-hit, with total confirmed cases breaching the 1 million mark late on Friday, making it the first state or province anywhere in the world to cross that mark.\n\nIf the state, which is India’s richest, were a country, it would rival Russia for the fourth highest number of coronavirus cases globally.\n\nIn some parts of the state, medical oxygen was becoming hard to find. Dr Amit Thadhani, Medical Director of Niramaya Hospitals in Panvel, a suburb of India’s financial capital Mumbai, said the shortage in his area was acute.\n\n“The problem is that the filling stations are themselves not getting supply of oxygen from the manufacturers. Supplies are extremely limited,” Thadhani said.\n\n“If we ask for 50 cylinders, we may get about 5 to 7.”\n\nAn official from the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation in a neighbouring suburb said they had received reports from multiple hospitals about dwindling oxygen supplies and made requests to state authorities. “Demand has risen in last few day because of rising cases,” the official said.\n\nThe Corporation’s commissioner Abhijit Bangar was not immediately available for comment.\n\nGovernment officials and experts said the unabated rise in cases in Maharashtra and other parts of the country were likely a result of economic activity restarting, local festivals and lockdown fatigue.\n\n“I am so disappointed with the pandemic situation in India,” Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan, who has been tracking India’s COVID situation closely, said on Twitter.\n\n“It is getting worse and worse each week but a large part of the nation seems to have made the choice to ignore this crisis,” she said."

The monsoon picked up again in August and were 27% above average.\n\nHeavy rains in August damaged some cotton, pulse and soybean crops in a few pockets. In the absence of any official estimate, trade, industry and government officials say the rains had localised impact and the damage was not widespread.\n\nBut heavy rains could cause extensive damage later this month when the crops ripen.\n\nTorrential rains would damage soybean and peanut which now need a relatively dry spell, said B.V. Mehta, executive director the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India.\n\nStill, soybean production could be higher than last year’s 9.3 million tonnes, Mehta said.\n\nCotton plucking would pick up in the next two weeks. If farmers receive excessive rainfall, both yields and quality will suffer, said Pradeep Jain, chief of the Khandesh Ginning and Pressing Factory Owners and Traders Association.\n\n“Some pulse crops suffered a bit of damage in August, and now there are concerns about heavy rains in the latter part of this month,” said Vivek Agrawal, who owns JLV Agro, a trading firm.\n\n“We are keeping our fingers crossed.”"

Jaishankar met in Moscow on Thursday and reached a five-point consensus, including agreements that troops from both sides should quickly disengage and ease tensions, the two countries said in a joint statement.\n\nThe consensus, struck on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting, came after a confrontation in the border area in the western Himalayas earlier this week.\n\n“The two Foreign Ministers agreed that the current situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side. They agreed therefore that the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions,” they said in the statement.\n\nJaishankar told Wang that the immediate task would be for troops to step back from the “areas of friction” so that things do not get worse, an Indian source said. Troops are barely a few hundred metres apart at some points.\n\nChina and India accused each other of firing into the air during the confrontation, a violation of long-held protocol not to use firearms on the sensitive frontier.\n\nWang told Jaishankar the “imperative is to immediately stop provocations such as firing and other dangerous actions that violate the commitments made by the two sides,” China’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday.\n\nWang also told Jaishankar all personnel and equipment that have trespassed at the border must be moved to de-escalate the situation.\n\nIn June, tensions erupted into a frontier clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed and China suffered an unspecified number of casualties.\n\nShares of defence-related firms fell in China on Friday after the news of progress in the talks, with the CSI National Defense Industry Index down 1.2% and on track for its steepest weekly decline since Oct. 12, 2018. Tongyu Heavy Industry shares tumbled as much as 16.4% at one point.\n\nCHINESE BUILDUP\n\nThe ministers’ meeting lasted for two hours and was the latest diplomatic effort to head off a broader conflict between the world’s two most populous countries, which went to war in 1962.\n\nJaishankar told Wang that India was deeply concerned about the buildup of Chinese forces on the Line of Actual Control on the poorly defined border.\n\n“The Chinese side has not provided a credible explanation for this deployment,” an Indian government source quoted Jaishankar as saying at the meeting.\n\n“The provocative behavior of Chinese frontline troops at numerous incidents of friction along the LAC also showed disregard for bilateral agreements and protocols,” Jaishankar said, adding any unilateral attempt to change status quo would be resisted.\n\nChina’s Global Times, an influential tabloid published by the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, reported on Wednesday the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were moving soldiers, bombers and armoured vehicles into the border.\n\nChinese state media also recently reported armed jump drills by PLA paratroopers in Tibet.\n\nThe Global Times said in an editorial published late on Thursday that any talks with India should be paired with “war readiness”.\n\n“The Chinese side must be fully prepared to take military action when diplomatic engagement fails, and its frontline troops must be able to respond to emergencies, and be ready to fight at any time,” the newspaper said."

  "title_summary": "Oxygen grows scarce in some parts of India as coronavirus cases rise MUMBAI (Reuters) - Oxygen supply has grown scarce in some parts of India hard hit by coronavirus, hospital and local government officials said, as India reported a record daily jump in cases for a second consecutive day, logging 97,570 new infections on Saturday.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nWith total cases of more than 4.65 million, India is the world’s second worst affected country, trailing only the United States, which has more than 6.4 million cases.\n\nTotal COVID-19 deaths stood at 77,472, putting India in third place in a ranking of countries’ fatalities. But the growth in infections in India is faster than anywhere else in the world, as cases surge through urban and rural areas.\n\nThe western state of Maharashtra has been particularly hard-hit, with total confirmed cases breaching the 1 million mark late on Friday, making it the first state or province anywhere in the world to cross that mark.\n\nIf the state, which is India’s richest, were a country, it would rival Russia for the fourth highest number of coronavirus cases globally.\n\nIn some parts of the state, medical oxygen was becoming hard to find. Dr Amit Thadhani, Medical Director of Niramaya Hospitals in Panvel, a suburb of India’s financial capital Mumbai, said the shortage in his area was acute.\n\n“The problem is that the filling stations are themselves not getting supply of oxygen from the manufacturers. Supplies are extremely limited,” Thadhani said.\n\n“If we ask for 50 cylinders, we may get about 5 to 7.”\n\nAn official from the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation in a neighbouring suburb said they had received reports from multiple hospitals about dwindling oxygen supplies and made requests to state authorities. “Demand has risen in last few day because of rising cases,” the official said.\n\nThe Corporation’s commissioner Abhijit Bangar was not immediately available for comment.\n\nGovernment officials and experts said the unabated rise in cases in Maharashtra and other parts of the country were likely a result of economic activity restarting, local festivals and lockdown fatigue.\n\n“I am so disappointed with the pandemic situation in India,” Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan, who has been tracking India’s COVID situation closely, said on Twitter.\n\n“It is getting worse and worse each week but a large part of the nation seems to have made the choice to ignore this crisis,” she said."

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports\n\n(Reuters) - Two-time major winner John Daly said on Thursday he has been diagnosed with bladder cancer and that while it was caught early he may need further surgery if it returns.\n\nThe 54-year-old American told Golf Channel the cancer was discovered during an appointment related to kidney stones.\n\n“(The doctor said) it doesn’t look like any stones are in there. But unfortunately, you have bladder cancer,” Daly said.\n\n“After I did the CT I was fixing to sip on my Diet Coke I got from McDonald’s and he said, ‘Don’t drink anything. We have to get you back in here and get this cancer out of you.’”\n\nDaly underwent surgery to remove the cancer but said there was an 85% chance it could return, which would require more surgery.\n\n“Luckily for me they caught it early, but bladder cancer is something that I don’t know all the details,” he said.\n\n“But it doesn’t look like it may go away. We will just see what happens. Maybe there’s a miracle.”\n\nDaly, a five-time winner on the PGA Tour, won his two majors at the PGA Championship in 1991 and the Open in 1995."

  "title_summary": "Osaka wins U.S. Open to confirm status as new star NEW YORK (Reuters) - Naomi Osaka ended Victoria Azarenka’s dream run to claim her second U.S. Open title in three years with a 1-6 6-3 6-3 comeback win on Saturday which cemented her status as the sport’s leading light both on and off the court.\n\nSep 12, 2020; Flushing Meadows, New York, USA; Naomi Osaka of Japan returns the ball against Victoria Azarenka of Belarus in the women's singles final match on day 13 of the 2020 U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nUnlike the 22-year-old Japanese’s first U.S. Open win in 2018 over Serena Williams, which was played in a frothing Arthur Ashe Stadium, Saturday’s drama unfolded in a strangely quiet arena as COVID-19 health and safety protocols prevented fans from entering the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.\n\nBut the lack of buzz around the stands did not stop the two former world number ones from producing a dazzling display of shot making.\n\nAs Osaka walked off with a third Grand Slam title, Azarenka was denied a U.S. Open crown for a third time having also finished runner-up in 2012 and 2013.\n\nStill it was a remarkable and unexpected run for the 31-year-old Belarusian, who reached her first major final in seven years.\n\nIt was the second time in two weeks Azarenka, twice a winner at the Australian Open, and Osaka had set up a final showdown. The pair had been set to meet in the Western and Southern Open final on Aug. 29 until Osaka withdrew due to a hamstring injury.\n\n“I actually don’t want to play you in more finals,” Osaka told Azarenka with a smile during the victory ceremony.\n\n“I didn’t really enjoy that.\n\n“That was a really tough match for me.\n\n“And yes, really inspiring for me because I used to watch you play here when I was younger so just to have the opportunity to play you is really great and I learned a lot.”\n\nCOVID-19 ERA\n\nThe presentation ceremony showed the precautions everyone has had to take during the COVID-19 era, with the two finalists having to pick up their respective prizes themselves from a table placed on court, while everyone stood socially distant for the obligatory photocall.\n\nAs she has done in every match over the past fortnight, Osaka appeared on court with her left thigh strapped and a facemask with the name of a Black American victim of police brutality or racial injustice.\n\nFor the final it was Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy shot by police in 2014 while playing with a toy gun in a playgound.\n\nOsaka had already replaced Serena Williams as top earner and now has assumed the leadership mantle that goes with it.\n\nWith the United States rocked by unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, just three weeks ago by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Osaka had withdrawn from her semi-final at the Western and Southern Open in protest.\n\nThe men’s and women’s tour responded by postponing all the matches that were due to take place on the day of the protest by 24 hours and persuaded Osaka to contest the rescheduled match.\n\nBy taking the stand, the 22-year-old activist had made her point.\n\nAzarenka, who ended Serena Williams bid for a record equalling 24th Grand Slam title in the semi-finals, carried that momentum into the final with a near flawless first set.\n\nOne of top returners in the women’s game, an energized Azarenka broke the fourth seed to start the final and twice more in a lopsided opening set that took just 27 minutes.\n\nIf any spectators had been allowed in Arthur Ashe Stadium, they no doubt would have been left stunned by events as a rampaging Azarenka again broke Osaka at the first opportunity in the second to go 2-0 up.\n\nBut Osaka would not lose her composure.\n\nAfter no aces in the opening set, Osaka, one of the game’s top servers, slowly began to find her mark in the second. She hammered down five aces while helping herself to three breaks on way to levelling the match.\n\nIn the third it was Osaka applying all the early pressure on an increasingly rattled Azarenka. She took charge with a break to nudge in front 3-1.\n\nAzarenka would show her fighting spirit with a break to get back on serve at 3-4 but Osaka would not be denied, immediately breaking back and holding serve to seal victory.\n\nIt marked the first time since Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in 1994 that a player had dropped the first set of the women’s final and fought back to win the title."

But we are very close to signing and I will race with Petronas next year.\n\n“I want to say 99% because it’s not signed. But I think that maybe in Barcelona we can give the announcement.”\n\nAfter enduring three difficult races in a row, championship leader Quartararo will be out to build on his three-point advantage at the top of the standings.\n\nIn his rookie season last year, the Frenchman battled with world champion Marc Marquez until the final lap at Misano before crossing the line in second place.\n\n“Honestly, it’s still difficult to believe that we’re still leading the championship. It’s crazy,” said Quartararo.\n\n“I’m confident because it’s a track that I like, I feel comfortable, let’s see. For sure I will give my maximum to fight for victory and the podium.”\n\nPramac Ducati’s Francesco Bagnaia and LCR Honda Castrol’s Cal Crutchlow have been declared fit for this weekend’s race.\n\nBagnaia missed the last three races due to a knee injury while Crutchlow is recovering from arm surgery."

TT News Agency/Claudio Bresciani via REUTERS\n\n- Makes Portugal debut in 1-0 friendly win over Kazakhstan in August 2003.\n\n- Selected for Portugal’s squad at Euro 2004, which the country hosted. He scores his first international goal in their opening game, a 2-1 defeat to Greece. Helps Portugal to the final, scoring again in the semi-final against the Netherlands, before they lose to the Greeks.\n\n- Makes his World Cup debut at the 2006 finals in Germany. Scores in the 2-0 win over Iran and helps Portugal reach the semi-finals where they lose to France.\n\n-Helps Portugal reach the quarter-finals at Euro 2008, scoring in the 3-1 win over the Czech Republic.\n\n- Portugal are eliminated from the 2010 World Cup by Spain in the last 16 and Ronaldo spits at a television cameraman as he walks off the pitch. Finishes with one goal, in the 7-0 win over North Korea.\n\n- Helps Portugal to the Euro 2012 semi-finals, where they are again knocked out by Spain, this time on penalties. Ronaldo is listed as the last of the five penalty-takers but does not get to take his kick as Portugal have already lost by then. Finishes the tournament with three goals.\n\n-Scores a hat-trick in a World Cup qualifying playoff against Sweden that gives Portugal a 3-2 win that takes them to the following year’s finals in Brazil.\n\n- In March 2014 overtakes Pauleta’s tally of 47 goals to become Portugal’s record scorer.\n\n- Ronaldo arrives at the World Cup on the back of a knee injury and looks off-colour. Portugal lose their opening game 4-0 to Germany and go out in the group stage. He scores once, in the 2-1 win over Ghana.\n\n- Helps Portugal to win Euro 2016, their first major trophy. After missing a penalty in a 0-0 draw against Austria, Ronaldo scores twice as they draw 3-3 with Hungary to squeeze into the knockout stage. He also scores in the semi-final win over Wales.\n\nHe has to go off injured after 25 minutes of the final against France after tackle by Dimitri Payet and spends extra time on the touch-line galvanising his team mates as they win 1-0.\n\n- Scores 15 goals in 2018 World Cup qualifiers as Portugal top their group.\n\n- Scores a hat-trick in their opening 2018 World Cup game against Spain, including an 88th-minute free kick to draw 3-3, and becomes the fourth player to score in four World Cups. Nets his 85th international goal against Morocco to become Europe’s all-time top international goalscorer but misses a penalty in the 1-1 draw with Iran. Portugal lose to Uruguay in the last 16.\n\n- Scores a hat-trick against Switzerland as he helps Portugal win another trophy, the inaugural Nations League, in 2019.\n\n-Scores four goals in a 5-1 Euro qualifying win away to Lithuania in October 2019. Scores three more, his ninth international hat-trick, in the return match one month later and takes his Portugal tally to 99 with a late goal in the 2-0 win in Luxembourg which books Portugal’s place at Euro 2020.\n\n-Scores twice in a 2-0 win away to Sweden in the Nations League group stage to become only the second male player to score over 100 international goals after Iran’s Ali Daei (109)."

  "title_summary": "Facebook plans to expand its news tab beyond the US Facebook is planning to expand its dedicated news section and says it is “considering” the UK, Germany, France, India, and Brazil as possible recipients, it announced Tuesday. The company’s timeline is vague: “within the next six months to a year,” so it’s curious why Facebook would announce something not yet imminent. But given Facebook’s volatile history with the news industry, and the trend toward requiring platforms to pay news outlets for their content, it’s possible the company is simply testing the waters for its next move.\n\nFacebook launched its News tab to US audiences in June, with plans to pay publishers that participated. To qualify as a partner, Facebook required publishers to pass its integrity standards and to have large enough audiences. It said it would rely on third-party fact-checkers to monitor posts for clickbait, copyright violations, and sensationalist content.\n\nNotably absent from the list of possible countries that would receive the News tab next is Australia, which recently unveiled plans to compel tech platforms to help pay for the free content they disseminate. France, which is on Facebook’s list of possible future News targets, ordered Google to pay for content from French publishers in April.\n\nIn Tuesday’s announcement, company vice president of global news partnerships Campbell Brown says the News content may vary by country to keep pace with consumer habits. “We’ll work closely with news partners in each country to tailor the experience and test ways to deliver a valuable experience for people while also honoring publishers’ business models,” Brown wrote.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons for news publishers in the US and elsewhere to be wary of Facebook’s news efforts. Its News Feed algorithm and ad business have proven devastating for the industry, particularly for local news publishers. And its track record on news is littered with failures, including the infamous “pivot to video” movement of the early and mid-2010s, with publishers pouring resources into video production seeking to benefit from Facebook’s video platform. “Pivot to video,” however, has become a catchphrase meaning “short-sighted failure,” because it turned out Facebook had juiced the metrics. And of course there’s the debacle of the 2016 election cycle, which resulted in Facebook removing its Trending Topics section amid accusations it was biased against conservative media.\n\nWhat the regulatory environment will look like for Facebook and other social media platforms six months to a year from now is anyone’s guess, and it may depend, at least in the US, on the outcome of the November presidential election. Until then, it appears Facebook is holding its cards close to the chest."

  "title_summary": "Facebook’s big QAnon crackdown might have come too late The Interface is a daily column and newsletter about the intersection of social media and democracy. Subscribe here .\n\nBefore the Tide Pods challenge was a public health crisis, it was a joke. The laundry detergent capsules, which were originally released in 2012, evolved over time to look strangely delicious: lush green and blue gels, swirled around one another attractively, all but daring you to eat them. This led to many jokes about Tide Pods maybe secretly being candy, and it might have stopped there — but then people actually started eating them. The “Tide Pods challenge” surged on social networks in 2018, and ultimately more than 10,000 children were reported to have been exposed to whatever extremely inedible substance is actually inside Tide Pods. Of teenagers who were affected, more than a quarter of the cases were intentional, the Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nEventually platforms banned the Tide Pods challenge, and the mania around their consumption subsided. But the story posed questions to platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter that they have struggled to answer ever since. When do you start to take a joke seriously? When does dumb talk cross the line into something dangerous? When does a lunatic conspiracy theory cross the line from a shitpost into a potential incitement to violence?\n\nWhen, in other words, was the right time to ban any talk of the Tide Pod challenge?\n\nLooking back, it seems clear that the answer is “sooner.” But “sooner” is still not an answer to when.\n\nI thought about all this today reading about Facebook’s latest purge of accounts related to QAnon, the fringe theory that Donald Trump is an intelligent person working in secret to purge the country of Satanist pedophiles, while using lieutenants to send coded messages to 4chan users. (Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrozny wrote a definitive piece on QAnon’s origins as a grift for NBC News in 2018.) On its face, this theory seems no less a joke than the idea that TidePods secretly taste delicious. But as with the laundry detergent, thousands of Americans have now been poisoned by QAnon, and the consequences seem likely to be far more dire, and long-lasting.\n\nFirst, though, the purge. Here are Collins and Zadrozny on Wednesday for NBC News:\n\nFacebook on Wednesday banned about 900 pages and groups and 1,500 ads tied to the pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon, part of a sweeping action that also restricted the reach of over 10,000 Instagram pages and almost 2,000 Facebook groups pushing the baseless conspiracy theory that has spawned real-world violence. Facebook also took down thousands of accounts, pages and groups as part of what they called a “policy expansion,” seeking to limit violent rhetoric tied to QAnon, political militias and protest groups like antifa.\n\nTwitter made a similar move last month, banning 7,000 accounts and putting restrictions on 150,000 more. Both moves fell short of a full ban on discussing QAnon, though Facebook’s move to prevent QAnon groups from being recommended to users could cut off a key avenue for recruitment of new adherents. “While we will allow people to post content that supports these movements and groups, so long as they do not otherwise violate our content policies, we will restrict their ability to organize on our platform,” Facebook said in a blog post.\n\nIn the New York Times, Sheera Frenkel reported that Facebook began scrutinizing the movement more closely in May, when QAnon groups played an essential role in promoting the “Plandemic” hoax. But by that time, Q adherents were already running for Congress, and several had been linked to real-world violence. Frenkel writes:\n\nIn New York, a woman who had cited QAnon theories as a reason she wanted to “take out” the Democratic presidential nominee Joseph R. Biden Jr., was arrested on May 1 with dozens of knives in her car. The group has been linked to more than a dozen violent incidents over the last year, including a train hijacking; last month, a QAnon supporter rammed a car into a government residence in Canada. The spiking activity on its network, combined with real-world incidents, pushed Facebook to discuss policy changes to limit QAnon’s spread, the two employees said. But the conversations stalled because taking down QAnon-related groups, pages and accounts could feed into the movement’s conspiracy theory that social media companies are trying to silence them, the people said.\n\nThere are likely other reasons it took Facebook a couple of months to roll out these bans, and the company’s recent action against Boogaloo groups offers some clues. In that case, as in QAnon, the group’s boundaries are ambiguous, and ever shifting. Part of the appeal of QAnon is that many of its core messages are written in code, giving it the feel of an augmented reality game. But coded messages are harder to discern, particularly by policy teams that have not invested in unscrambling them. It’s easier to maintain the ironic detachment that defined our early reactions to the Tide Pods challenge — no one actually believes this stuff, right? — than it is to take any kind of preemptive action.\n\nBut in 2020 we know what happens when you let a movement fester. We have seen Reddit ignore its most racist forums until they spun out into thriving standalone communities. And we have now seen QAnon, which Facebook was recommending in its group recommendation algorithms until Tuesday, evolve into something like a new religion. Notably, Reddit banned QAnon forums starting in 2018 — long before it even banned hate speech — after the forums were found to be inciting violence.\n\nSomeone asked the president about QAnon on Wednesday, and he replied that he didn’t know all that much about them, but he appreciated that they seem to like him, and also that he is “saving the world.” Trump has fanned the flames of QAnon for years, retweeting dozens of accounts linked to the theory, and demonstrating that the group’s rise is much more than a problem of content moderation. When the president is praising a group that his own FBI has designated a domestic terrorism threat, the solutions are not at the level of platform policy.\n\nStill, Facebook made it clear today that, like other networks before it, the company does consider QAnon a problem. As with Tide Pods, it seems likely that we’ll all look back and wish the company had taken Q seriously sooner. And if we want platforms to do better at managing whatever the next threat is that bubbles up, we would do well to reflect on when exactly that should have been.\n\nPushback\n\nYesterday I included a link to a story in Time about a request from the Gambian government to help investigate the genocide in Myanmar, where the United Nations has said Facebook contributed to the incitement of violence. Facebook wrote me last night to say that to comply with the request would violate users’ privacy:\n\nOne of the things that Matthew doesn’t mention is the fact that we are actively working with the UN’s Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar who are collecting evidence for any future proceedings. We recognize the extraordinary gravity of the atrocities in Myanmar, which is why we’re making a voluntary disclosure to the IIMM, which is required by its mandate to help all courts and tribunals seeking accountability for Myanmar. And a little more background on why we opposed The Gambia’s request: we have an obligation under the SCA not to release certain data to third parties, including the US and foreign governments, unless the user consents, there’s an emergency, the requesting party has a court order or the foreign government has a CLOUD Act agreement with the US. This means that for US companies to respond to a government’s request for most user data, those government need to have a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US and use the MLAT process to make the request. The Gambia doesn’t have either kind of agreement with the US, and the SCA doesn’t include exceptions for international justice efforts.\n\nIt’s true that there are lots of cases where we wouldn’t want to see Facebook indiscriminately handing over user data to governments, no matter how serious-seeming the request. So this feels like useful context to share.\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.\n\nTrending up: Facebook is supporting Black-owned businesses in the US with $40 million in grants. It’s also allowing them to identify their page as a Black-owned business so people can find and support them more easily. (Facebook)\n\nGoverning\n\n⭐ As Facebook executives promised to crack down on health misinformation, its algorithm appears to have fueled traffic to a network of sites sharing dangerously inaccurate news. A report by the nonprofit Avaaz found that pages from the top 10 sites peddling pandemic conspiracy theories received almost four times as many views on Facebook as the top 10 reputable sites for health information. (This is the unfortunate counterpoint to yesterday’s column here about the Plandemic sequel flop.) Emma Graham-Harrison and Alex Hern at The Guardian share some top findings:\n\nIt found that global networks of 82 sites spreading health misinformation over at least five countries had generated an estimated 3.8bn views on Facebook over the last year. Their audience peaked in April, with 460m views in a single month. “This suggests that just when citizens needed credible health information the most, and while Facebook was trying to proactively raise the profile of authoritative health institutions on the platform, its algorithm was potentially undermining these efforts,” the report said. A relatively small but influential network is responsible for driving huge amounts of traffic to health misinformation sites. Avaaz identified 42 “super-spreader” sites that had 28m followers generating an estimated 800m views.\n\nA top executive at Facebook in India is asking police to investigate death threats she received after the Wall Street Journal published a story saying she intervened to keep anti-Muslim hate speech online from politicians of India’s ruling Bharatiya Jana Party. How on earth does Facebook square its mission of “giving people a voice” with a top policy executive making a criminal complaint over a journalist criticizing them in a Facebook post? This seems ludicrous, and no one I talked to at Facebook on Wednesday could explain it to me. (Pranav Dixit and Ryan Mac / BuzzFeed)\n\nRelated: Facebook employees are now raising questions about whether content moderation practices are being followed by the India team in light of the allegations. A small group of employees penned an open letter demanding company leaders denounce “anti-Muslim bigotry” and ensure more policy consistency. (Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil / Reuters)\n\nIndia’s antitrust watchdog dismissed a case against WhatsApp, saying the company did not abuse its dominant position to expand in the country’s digital payments market. The case, filed in March, alleged that WhatsApp was bundling its digital payment service in its messaging app, which already had a large user base. (Reuters)\n\nInside the Boogaloo, America’s extremely online extremists. To understand the movement, this piece says, you first need to understand the militia movement that took root in the 1990s. But while militias are waiting for an imminent war, Boogaloo adherents seem intent on making the war happen. (Leah Sottile / The New York Times Magazine)\n\nSilicon Valley executives are rallying behind Kamala Harris as Joe Biden’s VP pick. While many tech workers supported more progressive candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, their bosses are relieved to have someone with closer ties to the valley. (Eric Newcomer / Bloomberg)\n\nPresident Trump said he supports Oracle buying TikTok. Oracle has closer ties to the White House than most other parties involved in the bidding, including Microsoft. Corruption in plain sight. (Aaron Tilley and Georgia Wells / The Wall Street Journal)\n\nA TikTok ban is overdue, this opinion writer argues. The privilege of accessing the open internet should extended only to companies from countries that respect that openness themselves. (Tim Wu / The New York Times)\n\nApple pulled more than 47,000 apps from the Chinese App Store earlier this month as tensions continue to rise between the US and China. The company recently eliminated a loophole that previously allowed paid games and games with in-app purchases to be sold even though they were still awaiting approval from Chinese regulators. (Jay Peters / The Verge)\n\nWeChat has helped Tibetan refugees keep in touch with their families. At the same time, its potential to be used as a surveillance tool have been causes of concern, particularly among Tibetan activists. (Tsering D. Gurung / Rest of World)\n\nTaiwan is planning to ban mainland Chinese streaming services iQiyi and Tencent Holdings from operating on the island. The move follows the US and India placing restrictions on Chinese tech companies amid heightened political tensions. (Iris Deng, Yujie Xue in Shenzhen and Josh Ye / South China Morning Post)\n\nTaiwan accused Chinese hackers of infiltrating government agencies to try and access sensitive data on citizens. The revelation comes as Taiwan has been caught up in the escalating struggle for global influence between the US and China. (Debby Wu / Bloomberg)\n\nData gleaned from two Twitter employees who allegedly spied on behalf of the Saudi government was later used to harass or arrest Saudi dissidents. Human rights organizations say they have identified six Saudi citizens who ran anonymous or pseudonymous Twitter accounts critical of the government who have been arrested. Chilling. (Ryan Gallagher / Bloomberg)\n\nHerman Cain’s Twitter account is bringing up uncomfortable questions around what should happen to a public figure’s social media profiles after they die. Should the account remain verified, or should it lose that status to better reflect the memorialized state of the account? Personally I hope to keep tweeting long after I’m dead, but just super generic stuff like “Thread” and “That’s it, that’s the tweet.” (Tamara Kneese / Slate)\n\nIndustry\n\n⭐ The stocks of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook now constitute 20 percent of the stock market’s total worth, a level not seen from a single industry in at least 70 years. This dominance is propelled by the companies’ unprecedented reach into our lives. Here are Peter Eavis and Steve Lohr at The New York Times:\n\nAmazon’s business, already towering over competitors in e-commerce and cloud computing, has become even more important to businesses and households. Its stock is up over 50 percent from its pre-pandemic high, underscoring just how much investors think it has benefited from the disruption. Critics say the companies have grown in part because of a range of anticompetitive practices. European regulators are investigating whether Apple’s App Store breaks competition rules. American regulators are looking at whether large tech firms committed antitrust abuses when acquiring other companies. Some antitrust scholars believe the rise of industry-dominating companies has led to stagnant wages and increased inequality. Last month, tech chief executives were grilled by members of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee.\n\nZoom is coming to the Amazon Echo Show, Facebook Portal, and Google Nest Hub Max later this year.

  "title_summary": "Top Facebook executive in India files criminal complaint against a journalist for sharing news report – TechCrunch Ankhi Das, a top Facebook executive in India, has filed a criminal complaint against a journalist who she alleges attempted to defame her in a public Facebook post and made “sexually coloured remarks.”\n\nA review of the journalist Awesh Tiwari’s post, written in Hindi (the most widely spoken language in India), finds that it was merely summarizing a recent WSJ report, which was critical of the way Das oversaw enforcement of Facebook’s hate-speech policies on some posts.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that Das, Facebook’s top public-policy executive in India, had opposed applying the company’s hate-speech rules to a member of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party.\n\nThe report said that posts from at least three more members of BJP individuals and groups were flagged internally for “promoting or participating in violence.” Punishing those violations by politicians from Modi’s party would damage the company’s business prospects in the country, Das said of those posts, according to the report, which cited current and former employees.\n\nThe article erupted a discussion on social media with several Indian politicians — both from Modi’s BJP party and the opposition Congress — criticizing one another and also Facebook for political biases. Several users also tweeted and submitted posts on Facebook criticizing Das’ decision.\n\nOn Monday, she filed a criminal complaint with the cyber unit of the Delhi police against a handful of users, including journalist Tiwari for posts that, she alleged, insulted and intimidated her, and made sexually coloured remarks.\n\nExcept, in the case of Tiwari, his post only summarizes WSJ’s report and shares some background information on Das that is in the public domain. WSJ, or its parent firm (News Corp), or its reporters are not named in Das’ criminal complaint with the police.\n\nTiwari told Indian news outlet Newslaundry that the Facebook executive’s action was curbing his freedom of speech on Facebook.\n\nIf charged and convicted, Tiwari and others stand to face fines and up to two years in prison for sexual harassment, up to two years for defamation and up to seven years in prison for criminal intimidation, according to the local law.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists called on Das Wednesday to withdraw her complaint against Tiwari and respect citizens’ rights to criticize her. In a conversation with CPI, Tiwari claimed he had received 11 phone calls from strangers who threatened him with lawsuits, physical harm and imprisonment ever since his name in Das’ complaint emerged.\n\nFacebook, a company apparently committed to freedom of speech, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nReuters reported on Wednesday that a handful of employees have written a letter asking Facebook to denounce “anti-Muslim bigotry” posts from BJP politicians that Ankhi Das protected and shared herself on the platform.\n\nIn a comment posted internally to employees, Ajit Mohan, the head of Facebook in India, said the company was confident that the WSJ article’s claim about political affiliations influencing decision making in India is “inaccurate and without merit,” Reuters reported.\n\nFacebook has yet to offer any evidence to dispute the claims made in the WSJ report — and has not disputed them at all in its statements to news outlets. In its public statements, Facebook has said it is making “progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits.”"

  "title_summary": "India’s Reliance Retail acquires a majority stake in online pharmacy Nedmeds’ parent firm for $83.2M – TechCrunch Reliance Retail has bought a 60% stake in pharma marketplace Netmeds’ parent firm Vitalic for about $83.2 million, it said today, as India’s largest retail chain looks to expand into new categories and compete more closely with American e-commerce group Amazon.\n\nReliance Retail said the deal, which grants it a 100% ownership of Vitalic’s subsidiaries (Netmeds, Tresara, and Dadha Pharma), valued the parent firm at about $134 million. Netmeds, which connects customers to pharmacists and enables door step delivery of medicines, serves 5.7 million customers in more than 670 cities and towns and online.\n\nThrough Netmeds, which had raised about $99 million prior to today’s announcement, consumers get access to more than 70,000 prescription drugs for chronic and recurring ailments as well as enhanced lifestyle drugs and thousands of non-prescription goods for wellness, health and personal care.\n\nReliance Retail plans to expand its ownership in Vitalic to at least 80% by April 2024 and holds the rights to own 100% in the future.\n\n“This investment is aligned with our commitment to provide digital access for everyone in India. The addition of Netmeds enhances Reliance Retail’s ability to provide good quality and affordable health care products and services, and also broadens its digital commerce proposition to include most daily essential needs of consumers,” said Isha Ambani, director of Reliance Retail, in a statement.\n\nYou know what I like about this? Local M&A is becoming a real thing. Mahindra bought a bunch earlier, like Firstcry, but those were super-distress. Reliance is like bring it on. Great for founders, one more beyond Inter-VC-deals and Softbank. — Deepak Shenoy (@deepakshenoy) August 18, 2020\n\nReliance Retail, like its sister telecom venture Jio Platforms, is a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, the most valued firm in India. Reliance Industries is run by Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest man.\n\nThe announcement late Tuesday evening (local time) comes days after Amazon struck a deal with Netmeds, 1mg, PharmEasy and Medlife to sell medicines online in Bangalore. It was the first time Amazon had expanded into this category, it said. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the adoption of telemedicine and pharma marketplaces in the country, analysts said.\n\nOnline sales of medicine in India, for which New Delhi currently does not have clear regulations, presents yet another major opportunity for Reliance Retail, which has expanded its new e-commerce venture — called JioMart — to more than 200 cities and towns in the recent quarters.\n\nLocal media has reported that Reliance is also in talks to acquire online furniture store Urban Ladder, milk delivery startup MilkBasket and Bangalore-based lingerie maker Zivame. TechCrunch reported last week that Reliance Industries was also in talks to acquire the India business of TikTok.\n\n“It is indeed a proud moment for ‘Netmeds’ to join Reliance family and work together to make quality healthcare affordable and accessible to every Indian. With the combined strength of the group’s digital, retail and tech platforms, we will strive to create more value for everyone in the ecosystem, while providing a superior Omni Channel experience to consumers,” said Pradeep Dadha, founder and chief executive of Netmeds, in a statement."

  "title_summary": "After restricting a group critical of Thailand’s monarchy, Facebook says it will take legal action against the government – TechCrunch After restricting a group critical of Thailand’s monarchy, Facebook says it will take legal action against the government\n\nAfter restricting access to a popular group with posts critical of Thailand’s monarchy, Facebook is planning legal action against the Thai government, which the social media giant says forced it to restrict content deemed to be illegal.\n\nOn Monday, Reuters reported access to Royalist Marketplace had been blocked within Thailand. Users there who try to visit the group, which has more than a million members, now see a message that says access to it has “been restricted within Thailand pursuant to a legal request from the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society.”\n\nIn a media statement emailed to TechCrunch, a Facebook spokesperson said, “After careful review, Facebook has determined that we are compelled to restrict access to content which the Thai government has deemed to be illegal. Requests like this are severe, contravene international human rights law, and have a chilling effect on people’s ability to express themselves. We work to protect and defend the rights of all internet users and are preparing to legally challenge this request.”\n\nThe spokesperson added, “excessive government actions like this also undermine our ability to reliably invest in Thailand, including maintaining an office, safeguarding our employees, and directly supporting businesses that rely on Facebook.”\n\nThe group was started in April by Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a dissident living in self-exile in Japan, where he is an associate professor of political science at Kyoto University’s Center for Southeast Asian Studies.\n\nPavin told Reuters that Royalist Marketplace “is part of the democratization process, it is a space for freedom of expression. By doing this, Facebook is cooperating with the authoritarian regime to obstruct democracy and cultivating authoritarianism in Thailand.”\n\nThe geo-restriction of Royalist Marketplace comes as thousands of pro-democracy protestors in Bangkok demand reform of the monarchy, including abolition of a strict lese-majeste law that mandates prison sentences of up to 15 years for people who defame members of the monarchy.\n\nPavin has been openly critical of Thailand’s monarchy. In a piece published on the Council of Foreign Relation’s website earlier this month, Pavin wrote that “for several decades now, the supposedly constitutional monarchy of Thailand has often proven to extend its powers beyond constitutional norms and rules,” intervening in politics as the current king, Maha Vajiralongkorn, established closer ties with the military.\n\nIn a 2014 New York Times opinion piece, Pavin described having a warrant issued for his arrest by the military junta that overthrew the democratically elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. He was also attacked by a intruder in his Kyoto apparent, which Pavin believes “was a warning for my continuing to hold, and express, my positions.”\n\nThe restriction of Thai users’ access to Royalist Marketplace took place three weeks after Thailand’s Minister of Digital Economy and Society, Puttipong Punnakanta, threatened to take action against Facebook because he said it did not comply quickly enough with the government’s requests to restrict content.\n\nIn 2016, Thailand enacted the Computer-Related Crime Act, which the Human Rights Watch warned “gives overly broad powers to the government to restrict free speech, enforce surveillance and censorship, and retaliate against activists.”\n\nFacebook is also under scrutiny in India, its biggest market by number of users, after The Wall Street Journal reported that Ankhi Das, the company’s top public policy executive in India, had opposed applying the platform’s hate-speech rules to a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party."

  "title_summary": "Taiwan set to bar Chinese streaming services like iQiyi and Tencent’s WeTV – TechCrunch Two of China’s most popular streaming services, iQiyi and Tencent’s WeTV, may be barred from operating in Taiwan next month as the government prepares to close regulatory loopholes that enabled them to offer local versions of their services through partnerships. But iQiyi and WeTV will still be accessible if subscribers are willing to, for example, use cross-border payment services to pay for subscriptions in China and deal with slower connections.\n\nIn an announcement posted this week, Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs said Taiwanese companies and individuals will be prohibited from providing services for OTT firms based in mainland China. The proposed regulation will be open to public comment for two weeks before it takes effect on September 3.\n\nThough Taiwan, which has a population of about 24 million people, is self-governed, the Chinese government claims it as a territory. The proposed regulations means Taiwan is joining other countries, including India and the United States, in taking a harsher stance against Chinese tech companies.\n\nWeTV and iQiyi set up operations in Taiwan through “illegal” partnerships, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said in its announcement, working through their Hong Kong subsidiaries to strike agreements with Taiwanese companies.\n\nIn April, the NCC declared that mainland Chinese OTT firms are not allowed to operate in Taiwan under the Act Governing Relations between People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. Cabinet spokesperson Kolas Yotaka said at the time that Chinese firms and their Taiwanese partners were operating at “the edges of the law.”\n\nBut NCC spokesperson Wong Po-Tsung said the proposed regulation isn’t targeted solely at Chinese OTT operators. According to the Taipei Times, he stated “the act was necessary because the cable television service operators have asked that the commission apply across-the-board standards to regulate all audiovisual service platforms, which should include OTT services. It was not stipulated just to address the problems caused by iQiyi and other Chinese OTT operators.”\n\nWong added that Taiwan is a democratic country and its government would not block people from watching content from iQiyi and other Chinese streaming services.\n\nOnce the act is passed, Taiwanese companies that break it will face fines of NTD $50,000 to NTD $5 million [about USD $1,700 to USD $170,000].\n\nIn a statement to TechCrunch, a spokeperson from iQiyi International, an iQiyi subsidiary based in Singapore, said it is playing close attention to the draft bill.\n\n“China’s mainland entities have always been allowed to carry out commercial activities in the Taiwan region since the enactment of the Act Governing Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area,” she added. “As streaming services are not classified as ‘special industries’ under the Act, such services should not become the specific target of legislation.”\n\nWeTV Hong Kong declined to comment."

  "title_summary": "India’s logistics SaaS startup FarEye bags $13 million – TechCrunch More than 150 e-commerce and delivery companies globally use an Indian logistics startup’s service to work out the optimum way to ship items to their customers.\n\nThat startup, Noida-based FarEye, said today it has raised an additional $13 million to close its Series D financing round at $37.5 million.\n\nFarEye first unveiled its Series D round in April this year when it raised from Microsoft’s venture fund M12, Eight Roads Ventures, Honeywell Ventures and SAIF Partners.\n\nThe startup said today industry veterans Nandan Nilekani and Sanjeev Aggarwal’s Fundamentum Partnership led the extended round, with participation from KB Global Platform Fund.\n\nFarEye helps companies orchestrate, track and optimize their logistics operations. Say you order a pizza from Domino’s; the eatery uses FarEye’s service, which integrates into the system it is using to quickly inform the customer how long they need to wait for the food to reach them.\n\nBehind the scenes, FarEye is helping Domino’s evaluate a plethora of moving pieces. How many delivery people are in the vicinity? Can it bundle a few orders? What’s the maximum number of items one can carry? How experienced is the delivery person? What’s the best route to reach the customer? And, would the restaurant need the same number of delivery people the following day?, explained Kushal Nahata, co-founder and chief executive of FarEye.\n\nLogistics firms have made minimal investment in digitisation. So, “the amount of visibility they have over their own delivery network is minimal. Forget what a customer should expect,” said Nahata, explaining the challenges the industry faces.\n\nFarEye is addressing this by using AI to parse through more than a billion data points to identify the optimum solution. In the past year, it has fine-tuned its algorithm to handle last-mile and long-haul deliveries to offer a full suite of services to its clients, said Nahata.\n\nThe startup, which raised capital for the second time in the middle of the global pandemic, said the virus has accelerated business activities for most of its clients as more people buy online to avoid visits to neighbourhood stores. In India, the current e-commerce orders exceed those of pre-coronavirus days already, he said.\n\nThe fresh capital will help the startup as it looks to scale ahead of the festive season, when people in India spend lavishly and thereby give more business to FarEye’s clients. It’s also the time when e-commerce firms clock record sales. The rest of the focus is on international expansion, said FarEye.\n\nThe startup, which already has clients in the U.S., Europe and Singapore, plans to further its growth outside of India. Nahata said several of its existing clients have extended their tie-up for operations in other markets.\n\n“Investment in the logistics space is essential for the economic growth of any nation. FarEye has captured the pulse of this industry and has all the ingredients to head towards global leadership. I believe in the founders and the team has the clarity of vision. We are excited to partner with FarEye in its journey to create a global technology leader in the logistics space,” said Aggarwal of Fundamentum, in a statement."

Most of the international founders couldn’t even come to the United States.\n\nNo matter where we are in the world, we all ended up working from home just like the rest of the planet. No Napa wine, no salt water taffy, no redwoods or Yosemite. Some of us even still have imperfect weather to contend with. Sigh.\n\nBut despite missing out on what would have been an amazing experience, we want to leave no doubt in the minds of your readers that the program has been fantastic. The SkyDeck team has provided us with:\n\nVIP access to an extraordinary network of contacts that has gone beyond what we could have imagined: Picture this network in your mind right now … it is even better than that.\n\nA network of quality advisors: SkyDeck does an amazing job of getting Berkeley alumni with extraordinary professional profiles to function as 1:1 advisors. This high-touch approach to mentoring has worked out smoothly during COVID-19 times because everyone is at home and eager to jump on a call. They have been there to provide advice, make connections, help us recruit, you name it.\n\nInfo sessions that are fun and informative: Bad internet access was sometimes annoying, but on the bright side, nobody had to fight traffic to get there. These sessions included everything from nuts and bolts organizational advice and war stories with Q&As from founders of famous companies to important new perspectives for building 21st-century companies such as DEI training. The speakers are also willing to have a call or hold office hours to discuss specific topics in-depth. It never stops.\n\nSupport from other cohort founders and alums: There is an incredible sense of family in the program. Tough times foster deep experiences and meaningful connections. The SkyDeck team did a great job setting up virtual events so we could all get to know each other, and alums are very active on Slack, responsive to requests for 1:1 mentorship, helping with recruiting and giving other free advice. We have all made new friends that can provide us with social and professional support for many years ahead.\n\nFull access to UC Berkeley’s diverse ecosystem including brilliant interns, faculty and industry connections. This has really helped us to boost productivity while pushing for product-market fit. Unfortunately, laboratories have been closed during the pandemic so some biotech and hardware founders, in particular, missed out on a perk they were really looking forward to. However, with everyone available online, bioinformatics, machine learning and other computational-focused collaborations have worked out great. Go Bears!\n\nAnd of course, a $100,000 investment that was highly appreciated during a pandemic when everyone needs cash to adapt to a completely transformed environment.\n\nWhile flight restrictions did cause some international founders to pull crazy hours from our home countries to participate in the sessions, virtual sessions allowed additional members of our teams to participate that would otherwise not have been able to do so. We are also hearing chatter that Demo Day will be larger than ever before because virtual events are much more scalable. But you didn’t hear that from us.\n\nWe are just starting investor month, and the meetings SkyDeck has been arranging leading up to Demo Day also feel more engaging and efficient. Investors do not have alternative options to communicate with founders, and it’s so much easier to jump from call-to-call than to physically jump around the Valley. Even super rich and famous investors seem to think it is fun to be in Zoom calls with us since, just like everyone else, they are probably kind of bored being at home all the time and just want somebody to talk to.\n\nSo yes, we did miss out on a lot we were hoping for when we joined SkyDeck, but even with virtual desks and virtual Demo Day, SkyDeck is absolutely worth it.\n\nSigned,\n\nSkyDeck Cohort 2020 founders:"

  "title_summary": "Triller threatened to sue over report suggesting it inflated its downloads – TechCrunch A new report disputing the validity of Triller’s recently announced download figures led Triller to respond with the threat of a lawsuit. Triller, a newly litigious TikTok rival that could potentially benefit from a TikTok ban in the U.S., has been pushing to capitalize on the recent turn of events regarding its chief competitor. Earlier this month, Triller issued a press release claiming it saw a surge of new downloads following the news of a possible TikTok ban, bringing Triller’s app to a total of 250 million global downloads across iOS and Android. The company also separately reported 65 million monthly active users. Estimates from third-party mobile data and analytics firms call these figures into question, however.\n\nInitially, the app store intelligence firm Apptopia crunched the numbers around Triller’s downloads and found the claim of 250 million downloads to be inflated. According to its analysis, Apptopia had estimated Triller’s app has been downloaded 52 million times since launch across both iOS and Google Play worldwide, not 250 million times, as Triller had said.\n\nTechCrunch reached out to Triller for comment on Apptopia’s findings. Triller and Apptopia then ended up independently getting in touch with one another, through a shared investor. After some back-and-forth between the two, Apptopia decided to pull its report.\n\nDuring this time, Triller also threatened to sue Apptopia for providing false information in a comment provided to TechCrunch.\n\nTriller CEO Mike Lu told TechCrunch, via an emailed statement, that Apptopia “clearly have allowed themselves to become a pawn of these giant conglomerates, especially those like TikTok who we are in active litigation with for stealing our patents.” (Lu was referring to the recent lawsuit Triller filed against TikTok over patent infringement.)\n\n“We would have welcomed Apptopia with open arms had they just reached out to us, and helped them understand our numbers, and now they have just made themselves part of our TikTok litigation,” Lu threatened. “We will be pursuing a claim against them for spreading harmful, false and knowingly damaging information,” he said.\n\nThis is a fairly aggressive response over a dispute about app store downloads. Industry insiders understand that none of the app store analytics firms have perfectly accurate figures. Meanwhile, regular consumers can get a sense of how popular an app is just by looking at the app store’s top charts, which are public.\n\nFor further context around the now heavily disputed download number, we asked mobile data and analytics firm App Annie and app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower for their own Triller data. App Annie declined to share downloads, but shared ranking data. Sensor Tower’s data, meanwhile, indicated Triller had reached 45.6 million total global installs across iOS and Android since its launch. That’s even lower than the 52 million figure Triller had vehemently disputed.\n\nSensor Tower suggested the discrepancies between third-party estimates and Triller’s own numbers could have to do with how Triller counted its installs. Some publishers count other forms of installs, like re-installs, updates and direct installs of Android APKs (meaning, installs outside of Google Play). Third-party firms don’t see these figures. Third-party firms also don’t count things like re-installs because that’s effectively counting the same user twice. Sensor Tower, of course, doesn’t know how Triller was counting installs internally.\n\nThough Apptopia is no longer standing behind its original report and estimate of 52 million installs, its report contained some other interesting insights that are still worth looking at, as they don’t rely on its forecasting technology.\n\nFor instance, Triller recently told CNBC it had 65 million monthly active users (MAUs). Counting an app’s MAUs is a way to measure its current usage and popularity. This tends to be a much smaller figure than an app’s total downloads, as not everyone who tries out an app sticks with it as a regular user.\n\nUsing Triller’s own download figure of 250 million and its own 65 million MAU figure, it’s claiming a lifetime retention rate of 26%. (The lifetime retention rate is determining the percentage of the app’s total downloads the current MAU number represents.) Triller’s rate is well above what the best apps in the industry are able to achieve.\n\nSnapchat has a lifetime retention rate of 20%, for example. TikTok has an 11% lifetime retention rate. Triller’s is higher, based on its own figures.\n\nTriller’s response to this part of the claim is that its app has changed a lot since its 2015 launch. It didn’t become a social media platform, for example, until 2018. It says if you look at the 90-120 day retention figures for TikTok or Snap, they would be above 30%, which is how its numbers should be compared.\n\nApptopia’s report also pointed to Triller’s App Store and Google Play chart rankings as another data point in questioning Triller’s download claims.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, the app store chart rankings are driven by downloads combined with other factors, like velocity of downloads, ratings, user retention and more.\n\nTo analyze Triller’s claim in the context of its chart rankings, Apptopia examined several other popular U.S. apps for comparison’s sake, including Twitter, Pinterest, Gmail and Twitch.\n\nThese apps were selected because they had a similar number of U.S. downloads to Triller for the time period Apptopia used to analyze Triller’s claim: July 23, 2015-August 2, 2020. The former is the date of Triller’s launch and the latter is when it issued a press release stating its 250 million download figure.\n\nSimply put, if Triller’s 250 million figure was correct, then the app would seemingly appear much higher on the U.S. App Store and Google Play charts than it does.\n\nOn iOS, the average overall ranking for Gmail during this time period was No. 17, Twitter was No. 35, Pinterest was No. 33 and Twitch was No. 233. Triller, meanwhile, was No. 353. (Twitch is lower than the others because it’s a less-used app, because chart rankings aren’t entirely download-dependent and because many Twitch users stream on the desktop, not mobile. But even it ranks higher than Triller.)\n\nYou can see that Triller consistently trends well below the others in the U.S. charts. This trend is even clearer when zoomed into the last 90 days (see below).\n\nApptopia’s estimate here is also in line with App Annie’s data. Though App Annie couldn’t pull a lifetime average rank, as Apptopia did, it was able to pull Triller’s average U.S. iPhone App Store Overall rank for the past 90 days, which was No. 303.\n\nA similar trend can be seen on Google Play, where Triller doesn’t even rank in the Overall category enough days during the given time frame to be statistically relevant. (Gmail didn’t either, but that’s because the app is preinstalled on many Android phones, so users don’t need to download it.)\n\nTriller’s response to this claim is that it, again, was a different app before 2018 and it has hit No. 1 in many non-U.S. markets, including Korea, where it’s currently No. 1. In the last 10 days, it has been No. 1 in Pakistan, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, Italy and France, and in the last 30 days in India, U.S., South Africa, Nigeria and dozens of others.\n\n“Our growth and numbers are very fresh and very new, so taking anything long term or just the U.S. is neither relevant nor applicable to us,” said Triller CEO Mike Lu.\n\nThe timing of Triller’s claim of 250 million downloads follows reports that said the startup is raising hundreds of millions in new funding. Fox Business recently reported Triller has “commitments from investors of $200 million to $300 million.” Pegasus Tech Ventures, a Triller investor, emailed journalists in early August to pitch Triller coverage, saying the app was “now raising around $250m at a $1B valuation.”\n\nTriller also recently made news for suing TikTok over patent infringement, verified in court filings TechCrunch pulled from PACER.\n\nNone of this is coincidental. Triller has been angling to become the TikTok alternative that wins the U.S. market in the event TikTok can’t get a deal done in the time allotted by Trump’s executive order requiring TikTok to sell its U.S. operations or be banned in the country.\n\nMr. Lu disputed claims made by third-party mobile data firms, when reached for comment. The company stands by its numbers.\n\n“No app intelligence firm has been provided our data,” Lu said. “Any numbers they provide have no relevance or accuracy to our numbers. We are able to validate each and every one of our users. They should also disclose which of our competitors are paying them hundreds of thousands of dollars such as TikTok,” he added.\n\nLu also openly wondered if a Triller competitor was feeding false information. His full statement is below:\n\nThe biggest app intelligence firms have less than 1M total users/customers and less than a few hundred large companies actually providing them real data, any numbers they present are based solely on guessing based on a very small sample group and are far from accurate. The terms of service of all app intelligence firms state that any numbers they provide come from their own guesstimates. While certain companies pay upwards of a few hundred thousand dollars to these firms and give them access to their numbers, we have not provided such access. Any numbers provided by them are wholly inaccurate and they themselves state they have no actual way of validating without us providing them access. These is clearly just a transparent attack by one of our competitors who pays them handsomely to disseminate this false information. It’s sad to see firms that are supposed to be neutral and claim to be pro entrepreneurial and pro American allow themselves to become a pawn of these giant conglomerates, especially those like TikTok who we are in active litigation with for them stealing our patents.”\n\nFollowing their conversation with Triller, Apptopia tells us it will soon have access to more accurate figures for Triller and will release those at a later time. The companies seem to be working things out.\n\nApptopia says:"

  "title_summary": "Here are four areas the $311 billion CPPIB investment fund thinks will be impacted by COVID-19 – TechCrunch Here are four areas the $311 billion CPPIB investment fund thinks will be impacted by COVID-19\n\nThe Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, an asset manager controlling around $311 billion in assets for Canada’s pensioners and retirees, has identified four key industries that are set to experience massive changes as a result of the global economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe firm expects massive changes in e-commerce, healthcare, logistics and urban infrastructure to remain in place for an extended period of time and is urging investors to rethink their approach to each as a result.\n\n“It really ties into the mandate that we have in thematic investing,” said Leon Pedersen, the head of Thematic Investments at CPPIB.\n\nThere was a realization at the firm that structural changes were happening and that there was value for the fund manager in ensuring that the changes were being addressed across its broad investment portfolio. “We have a long-term mandate and we have a long-term investment horizon, so we can afford to think long term in our investment outlook,” Pedersen said.\n\nThe Thematic Investments group within CPPIB will make mid-cap, small-cap and private investments in companies that reflect the firm’s long-term theses, according to Pedersen. So not only does this survey indicate where the firm sees certain industries going, but it’s also a sign of where CPPIB might commit some investment capital.\n\nThe research, culled from international surveys with over 3,500 respondents, as well as intensive conversations with the firm’s investment professionals and portfolio companies, indicates that there’s likely a new baseline in e-commerce usage that will continue to drive growth among companies that offer blended retail offerings and that offices are likely never going to return to full-time occupancy by every corporate employee.\n\nAlready CPPIB has made investments in companies like Fabric, a warehouse management and automation company.\n\nThe e-commerce wave has crested, but the tide may turn\n\nAmid the good news for e-commerce companies is a word of warning for companies in the online grocery space. While usage surged to 31% of U.S. households, up from 13% in August 2019, consumers gave the service poor marks and many grocers are actually losing money on online orders. The move online also favored bigger omni-channel vendors like Amazon and Walmart, the study found.\n\nThe CPPIB also found that there may be opportunities for brick and mortar vendors in the aftermath of the epidemic. As younger consumers return to shopping centers they’re going to find fewer retailers available, since bankruptcies are coming in both the U.S. and Europe. That could open the door for new brands to emerge. Meanwhile, in China, more consumers are moving offline, with malls growing and customers returning to shopping centers.\n\nSome of the biggest winners will actually be online entertainment and cashless payments — since fewer stores are accepting cash and music and video streaming represent low-risk, easier options than live events or movie theaters.\n\nHealthcare goes digital and privacy matters more than ever\n\nConsumers in the West, already reluctant to hand over personal information, have become even more sensitive to government handling of their information despite the public health benefits of tracking and tracing, according to the CPPIB. In Germany and the U.S. half of consumers said they had concerns about sharing their data with government or corporations, compared with less than 20% of Chinese survey respondents.\n\nHowever, even as people are more reluctant to share personal information with governments or corporations, they’re becoming more willing to share personal information over technology platforms. One-third of the patients who used tele-medical services in the U.S. during the pandemic did so for the first time. And roughly 20% of the nation had a telemedicine consultation over the course of the year, according to CPPIB data.\n\nTechnologies that improve the experience are likely to do well, but because of the people who did try telemedicine, satisfaction levels in the service went down.\n\nCities and infrastructure will change\n\n“From mass transit to public gatherings, few areas of urban life will be left unmarked by COVID-19,” write the CPPIB report authors.\n\nRemote work will accelerate dramatically, changing the complexion of downtown environments as the breadth of amenities on offer will spread to suburban communities where residents flock. According to CPPIB’s data, roughly half of workers in China, the U.K. and the U.S. worked from home during the pandemic, up from 5% or less in 2019. In Canada, four-in-10 Canadians were telecommuting.\n\nTo that end, the CPPIB sees opportunities for companies enabling remote work (including security, collaboration and productivity technologies) and automating business practices. On the flip side, for those workers who remain wedded to the office by necessity or natural inclination, there’s going to need to be cleaning and sanitation services, and someone’s going to have to provide some COVID-19-specific tools.\n\nWith personal space at a premium, public transit and ride hailing is expected to take a hit as well, according to the CPPIB report.\n\nSupply chains become the ties that bind in a distributed, virtual world\n\nAs more aspects of daily life become socially distanced and digital, supply chains will assume an even more central position in the economy.\n\n“Amid rising labor costs and heightened geopolitical risk, companies today are focused on resilience,” write the CPPIB authors.\n\nCompanies are reassessing their reliance on Chinese manufacturing since political pressure is coming from more regions on Chinese suppliers thanks to the internment of the Uighur population in Xinjiang and the crackdown on Hong Kong’s democratic and open society. According to CPPIB, India, Southeast Asia and regional players like Mexico and Poland are best positioned to benefit from this supply chain diversification. Supply chain management software providers, and robotics and automation services stand to benefit.\n\n“Confined to their homes for months and subjected to a rapid reordering of their perceived health risks and economic prospects, consumers are emerging from a shared trauma that will change their priorities and concerns for years to come,” the CPPIB study’s authors write."

  "title_summary": "Five proven ways to attract and hire more diverse talent – TechCrunch A few years ago, I came to the realization that my company, an HR consulting firm, was not as diverse as I wanted it to be. I value diversity because I know it makes teams better — more creative, more productive and more nimble. It helps my firm represent our community and serve our clients.\n\nThough I tried to be inclusive in the language and the images I used on my website, in social media and when posting job openings, clearly something wasn’t working. I’m fortunate to know many talented diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) experts. I asked them what I needed to do differently to attract a broader and more diverse pool of candidates. Here’s what they told me.\n\nDefine what diversity means to you\n\nThis may seem obvious, but it’s actually something many companies don’t do. When we talk about diversity, people tend to think only of race and gender. Our definition of diversity can be narrow, and we fail not only to include physical ability, gender identity and a host of other underestimated groups, but to recognize that even within a company, who is well represented versus underrepresented can vary by team or department.\n\nI noticed a lack of diversity among my team of coaches; it was all women, but there were few women of color. The gender imbalance is not a surprise; according to the International Coaching Federation (ICF), approximately two-thirds of coaches are women. It would have been all too easy to throw up my hands and say “Well, there just aren’t enough qualified male coaches.” But blaming the pipeline is not a valid excuse and doesn’t fix the problem.\n\nIf I told people, “I’m trying to increase diversity on my team,” they would not have known what I meant; they would have been left to assume. Instead, I reached out to a small group of coaches who I know and trust, and told them “I’m looking for more coaches. Specifically, I would like to add women of color and I’d also like to have more men on the team.”\n\nIn the U.S., where we’ve been taught for so long not to talk about race or gender while hiring, this felt awkward. I had to push past that, and I’m thankful I did. The result was that I was not only able to add a number of experienced coaches to my team, I also built a whole new network of talented, diverse coaches from whom I continue to learn.\n\nWrite more inclusive job descriptions\n\nWhen you want to appeal to the most diverse candidates, language matters. It is (hopefully) obvious that terms like rock star, stud and ninja, which have been used all too frequently in job descriptions, are exclusive and off-putting to many candidates. But other words and phrases to use or avoid aren’t always common sense. The most appealing language can vary by job level, title and even geography.\n\nUsing a tool like Textio will help you create a job description that welcomes the most candidates to apply. Textio uses machine learning and algorithms from millions of job descriptions to help you spot and remove language that can unintentionally narrow your pool. Pop in your job description and you’ll get recommendations about the optimal length of your JD, word choices that skew masculine or feminine, sentence length and even whether your job suggests a fixed or growth mindset.\n\nPersonalize your equal opportunity hiring statement\n\nWe’ve all seen the old equal employment opportunity (EEO) statement at the end of a job posting, which reads: “We’re an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status.” It sounds like it came right off the government website, which it probably did. And that’s exactly how it comes across to candidates — like a canned message that you’ve added just to make sure you’re in compliance.\n\nDid you know that you can customize your EEO statement? People do read it, and sticking with the legal jargon can be off-putting. A generic statement doesn’t say anything positive about your brand, and it doesn’t demonstrate a true commitment to diversity. If you haven’t already, now is the perfect time to update your statement, making it more reflective of your culture and values. For example:\n\n“SurveyMonkey is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.”\n\nIs it worth the effort? According to FairyGodboss, these personalized EEO statements “…communicate an employer’s dedication to unbiased recruiting, hiring and employment practices, which may encourage traditionally marginalized groups to seek employment within the organization.”\n\nConduct blind resume reviews\n\nMost people are familiar with unconscious bias, and how it can negatively impact every step of the hiring process. Even as early as the resume review, bias causes recruiters and hiring managers to favor resumes of candidates who are in the majority. Bias can result from information ranging from a candidate’s name to which college they attended or which sports they played.\n\nFor instance, those with white-sounding names receive preference. The National Bureau of Economic Research found that “Job applicants with white names needed to send about 10 resumes to get one callback; those with African-American names needed to send around 15 resumes to get one callback.” I have a friend from India who received similar treatment. Even though she had worked with well-known companies, including Google and Deloitte, she had difficulty landing a job when she first came to the U.S. When she was ready to change employers, she adopted an American nickname on her resume and LinkedIn profile, and promptly got five callbacks.\n\nIn a blind resume review, identity cues that indicate race or gender are hidden. Tools like TalVista do this automatically, or your team can do it manually by hiding the information. While this helps increase the number of diverse candidates who make it to the next step, it does not address bias that occurs during interviews or later in your hiring process. That’s going to require training.\n\nAssemble diverse interview panels\n\nPeople from underestimated groups are all too familiar with the phrase “you have to see it to be it.” If I can’t see myself as someone who will be welcome and included in your company, I’m far less likely to join it. Yet too often even when a candidate meets with multiple interviewers, none of those interviewers reflect the candidate’s race or gender.\n\nImagine a woman of color spending the better part of a day meeting with a potential employer. Over the course of several hours, she meets a number of leaders but she doesn’t meet a single woman of color. She might think there are no women of color in the company, or wonder why they are not included in important decisions like interviewing and hiring.\n\nWhen Karenga Ross interviewed at Intel after meeting them at a National Society of Black Engineers conference, she was pleasantly surprised to meet two African American women on the interview panel — these were women who looked like her. “It’s nice to be able to look across that table and see someone whom I can aspire to be. I can see someone who looks like me. It was refreshing. It was inspiring.”\n\nOne question I get from small companies is how to assemble a diverse interview panel if they don’t yet have diversity within their organization. I encourage them to cast a wide net. Think about who’s affiliated with your company, even if they’re not employees. If you have diverse advisors, investors or board members who are willing to help, invite them to join your panel. It will improve the candidate experience and help eliminate bias from your decision making.\n\nIncreasing diversity is an important investment that takes commitment, and a willingness to learn and experiment. You’ll have to try out some new things, and perhaps have conversations that make you uncomfortable. Remember to take one step at a time, and measure your progress and results.\n\nDiverse hiring is one important step toward increasing diversity in your organization. Retention, however, depends on all employees feeling a sense of belonging. Remember to review your internal practices and policies to make sure they too meet the test of inclusion."

Like many N.F.L. team owners, Daniel Snyder has faced his share of losing on the field and scandals in the front office during his 21-year stewardship of the club. Some problems were the result of bad luck. Others were self-inflicted.\n\nSnyder, though, is now juggling calamities on several fronts. In just the past few months, he ditched the team’s 87-year-old name and logo after a revolt by sponsors, hired a law firm to investigate reports of sexual harassment in the front office and began a legal battle that has implicated a limited partner who is trying to sell his shares in the franchise. Most recently, the head coach he hired to revive the team said he would lead while undergoing cancer treatment.\n\n“The Washington Football Team is like Charlie Brown trying to fly his kite and getting it caught in the tree,” said MacCambridge, the author of “America’s Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation.” “There have been teams that were historically bad. The frustration that the fans in Washington are experiencing is that they’ve been waiting an awful long time to get a sense that their club has a positive sense of direction, and they’re still waiting.”"

  "title_summary": "'Tenet' reviews are in. Here's what the critics are saying. Reviews are out for Christopher Nolan's latest movie Tenet, which is coming to select countries on Aug. 26 due to COVID-19 before its U.S. debut in some theaters on Sept. 3.\n\nWhile the thrills and action that fill this mysterious film shine for many critics, many are also pointing to hefty helpings of confusion stemming from the movie's use of time travel and red herrings in this John David Washington-led project.\n\nIt sounds like it's pretty par for the course for a Nolan movie, mixing the themes of time and perception as he's done in Memento, Inception, and Interstellar with espionage for a largely entertaining yet befuddling experience.\n\nHere's what the critics who've seen it are saying about the first big movie release to hit theaters in months.\n\nAn intriguing structure\n\nMashable, Shannon Connellan\n\nLike its title, Tenet is a cinematic palindrome, moving backwards and forwards in a multitude of ways. As novel an idea as this is, the film essentially follows the conventions of a classic spy thriller. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but spices it up with time manipulation. You know the setup, if you’ve watched James Bond films: luxe location shoots, a highly-skilled, witty protagonist, a friendly sidekick, a crazed billionaire villain, extremely well-tailored suits.\n\nThe JC, Linda Marric\n\nFrom the outset, it’s important to point out that one must be especially careful regarding spoilers when discussing Tenet, for those who haven’t seen it yet. As with any Nolan narrative, a number of very intricate ideas are beautifully laid out here. Some of these ideas are undeniably smart, and even those aspects that border on the preposterous side of things cannot hinder our overall enjoyment of the film.\n\nRevisiting ideas he had already broached in his brilliantly underrated space saga Interstellar, Nolan is back again to his favourite subject, Time. He presents us with various deeply philosophical questions about the passing of time and its effect on who we are and on our own actions. These themes help to make Tenet so much more than just another sci-fi spy thriller.\n\nThe Guardian, Catherine Shoard\n\nAs the eagle-eyed have pointed out, Tenet is a palindrome, which means it’s possible you’ll see some of the same scenes twice. Yet, for all the nifty bits of reverse chronology, there’s little that lingers in the imagination in the same way as Inception or even Interstellar’s showcase bendy business.\n\nConfusion abound\n\nMashable, Shannon Connellan\n\nFrom the very first (literal) bang, Tenet lets fly with a flurry of information without context, communicated in coded language. Keeping track of events proves as perplexing for the viewer as it does the characters. But if you’ve seen Nolan’s other films, especially Inception, you’re across this layering of riddles in breadcrumb form, and reach a point where you just let the words wash over you, expecting things will become clear eventually. This doesn’t exactly happen though. After the literal turning point of the film, some details are solved, but many others are left ambiguous. And if they are explained, they’re muffled by the mixing of Ludwig Göransson’s booming score, so ever-present it takes on a character of its own. It could be my own EDM-ruined eardrums, but this dull throb erased conversations between characters. And you cannot miss a detail in this film.\n\nIndependent, Clarisse Loughrey\n\n[John David Washington] stumbles into a great, yawning chasm of possibility and probability – namely, the discovery that objects can travel forwards and backwards through time, carving out wide channels in the fabric of reality. It’s a time travel film. But, also, as the director himself insists, not a time travel film. It’s the most complex of Nolan’s contraptions. It can be frightening. It can be claustrophobic. At times, it verges on the incomprehensible. We expect the complex and byzantine from Nolan’s work. But here, with an idea he’s wrestled with for over a decade, the director’s managed to reach new heights of obfuscation.\n\nThe Guardian, Catherine Shoard\n\nYou exit the cinema a little less energised than you were going in. There’s something grating about a film which insists on detailing its pseudo-science while also conceding you probably won’t have followed a thing. We’re clobbered with plot then comforted with tea-towel homilies about how what’s happened has happened.\n\nRobert Pattinson and John David Washington bring solid performances to 'Tenet.' Image: warner bros. pictures\n\nPlenty of thrilling action to entertain\n\nThe Wrap, Nicholas Barber\n\nTenet is one of those slick wish-fulfillment fantasies in which someone will say that he needs four trucks, 10 men and a suitcase full of explosives to pull off a heist, and in the next scene, everything he has asked for will be ready and waiting. No equipment is unavailable; no henchmen are held up at customs. Dialogue is pared down to perfunctory exposition, and the characters hop from India to Italy to Norway to Ukraine so easily that they might as well have a teleporter stashed next to their inverted munitions.\n\nIn other words, “Tenet” is a glossy international espionage thriller, which, like “Inception,” pays elaborate homage to the James Bond series. Nolan delivers nearly everything you might expect from the genre, from gorgeously scenic locations to frantic car chases, from brutal restaurant-kitchen fights to — best of all — a bungee jump up instead of down a Mumbai skyscraper. It’s exhilarating, in a Fast & Furious sort of way, especially as so many of the stunts are done for real rather than with CGI.\n\nSlashFilm, Jason Gorber\n\nA driving force for thrillers like this are the many exotic and photogenic locations, and the film doesn’t hesitate to put their characters in some heightened environments. From carbon fiber sailing yachts to Danish windfarms in the middle of the ocean, the scope is quite impressive. We see glimpses of India, Italy, Norway, the U.K., the U.S. and Estonia, the latter providing the setting for a massive sequence that takes place on a highway, with cars slamming from all directions of space and time. There are show-stopping spectacles at an airport using as much practical effect capacity as possible, another of Nolan’s common flourishes, making some of his earlier explosive events seem positively paltry.\n\nStandout acting\n\nMetro, Nola Ojomu\n\nIt’s also not hard to see why Nolan was reportedly so adamant to get Washington, son of Denzel, to play the lead. Following his impressive performances in BlacKKKlansman and HBO’s Ballers, the actor powers through the flick with a calm and sturdy demeanour, exuding the efficient nature one would expect from a top spy. His performance makes it clear the Protagonist is led by a gritty determination to do what it takes to protect the nation, on a mission that is even greater than the fight for one country. Washington has great chemistry with Pattinson, who couldn’t look like he was having more fun if he tried.\n\nThe List, Emma Simmonds\n\nIf he doesn't have the bulk to physically intimidate, Branagh shows a ferocity we've rarely, if ever, seen from him on screen; it's an interesting piece of casting. Washington is a fine focus: committed, kick-ass and ever so slightly imperious, there's no wise-cracking here. Debicki's imperilled wife and mother does feel dated, but the actress plays her with total conviction, adding notes of humanity that we don't get elsewhere, with so many necessary enigmas or fleeting appearances (from Michael Caine, Clémence Poésy, Martin Donovan and, with a little more screen-time, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a gruff soldier).\n\nWATCH: What to binge on the best 30-day free trials"

  "title_summary": "The ‘Rage Moms’ Democrats Are Counting On As the pandemic roars on, voters across America remain deeply angry and worried about the future. But the vocal outrage from women, in particular, is clear on protest lines and in polling data. Women were more likely than men to report having participated in protests over the past two years, and mothers with children in the home were twice as likely as fathers to report participating in a protest, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll from June.\n\nNow, the rage moms are railing in Facebook groups about school shutdowns and in teacher union meetings about reopening without proper protection from the virus. They’re also packing virtual town halls with frustrations about schools, child care and the lack of leadership.\n\n“There’s nobody giving us solutions,” said Kim Lopez, a mother of three in Glendale, Ariz., and part-time financial assistant, who is still unsure what her children’s schooling will look like this year. Ms. Lopez said she never considered herself political until this summer, when she brought her children to a small Black Lives Matter protest in the Phoenix suburbs. “It’s as if they don’t care what happens to families.”\n\nMs. Lopez is exactly the kind of voter Democrats hope will push them to victory in November, and they are aiming to turn that frustration with government inaction into a vote against Mr. Trump.\n\nLast month, the Biden campaign kicked off a “Moms for Biden” group. On Zoom, one person after another spoke of fears and frustrations. Asked to name the most pressing issue for her, one mother couldn’t narrow it down. Instead, she simply said “less worry.”"

  "title_summary": "Review: ‘The Vow’ Follows Nxivm Down Dark, Damaging Paths “The Vow” creative team, led by the directors Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer, had plenty of raw material to work with. Members of the group appear to have documented nearly every conversation they had with each other and with Raniere during the past two decades, and many Nxivm seminars were also recorded. We don’t have to rely on the commentary from former members to see what Raniere was selling, and how much others helped him promulgate sexist mind-sets and increasingly deranged formulations of abuse as love.\n\nThe early episodes focus on how adherents were drawn in by Nxivm’s superficial resemblance to other self-help philosophies, then the documentary evolves into something of a slow-burn thriller. The viewer becomes a fly on the wall as the filmmakers follow a group of anti-Nxivm campaigners, including Edmondson, Vicente and the actresses Catherine Oxenberg and Bonnie Piesse, who implore the authorities and the media — including The Times — to do something about Raniere and his secretive inner circle. (Oxenberg’s daughter India was deeply involved in Nxivm — the group attracted quite a few Hollywood folks — and Catherine’s pain and relentless energy are affecting.)\n\nFor survivors of Raniere’s alleged patterns of financial and emotional abuse — which reach back at least three decades — the path toward healing and potential redemption often involves trying to undo the work they did for “Vanguard” and his lieutenants. There’s a lot of talk these days about the concept of restorative justice as a means of atoning for damage done, and the ex-Nxivm folks at the core of “The Vow” show what that idea looks like in action. Even as they bravely fight for justice for Raniere’s victims, they struggle with a painful array of things they wish they’d done differently.\n\nWhat is the path back for those who participate in — or look away from — abuse? Where’s the line between coercion and independence? What consequences is society willing to dish out when a storyteller with a committed following — in politics, in the arts, in self-help realms or anywhere else — is revealed to be a charismatic predator or canny charlatan? Those are the deeper questions that animate “The Vow” and help make it not just engrossing but extraordinarily relevant.\n\nIt occasionally also feels like a juicy soap opera, with glimpses into the lives of wealthy heiresses and the haunting rituals of a secret society. Though Mack is not interviewed, her adoration for Raniere can be seen in excerpts from glossy Nxivm promotional videos, and her descent into abject, destructive devotion is both tragic and fascinating.\n\nIn one of the series’s most chilling moments, we see Raniere and Mack chatting at one of the group’s late-night volleyball games. Raniere deftly manipulates her deepest vulnerabilities — they involve art, repression and emotion — and it’s as if the rabbit hole she is about to fall down takes shape before our eyes."

  "title_summary": "What Kamala Harris' Indian roots reveal about the US (CNN) When Shyamala Gopalan first came to the United States, there were only around 12,000 Indian immigrants living here.\n\nIt was 1958, seven years before a new law would transform the US immigration system and fundamentally change the face of the nation.\n\nBy 2018, there were nearly 2.7 million Indian immigrants living in the US. And now, Gopalan's daughter, Sen. Kamala Harris, is the first Indian American on a major party's presidential ticket\n\nHarris is the daughter of immigrants -- her mother from India and her father from Jamaica. Her vice presidential nomination marks a milestone and highlights a major demographic shift in the US in recent decades, as more immigrants began arriving from non-European countries.\n\n\"It's hugely significant. ... It is, first of all, really affirming and rooting into our consciousness that these demographic shifts are very much a part of our country and they are here to stay,\" says Virginia state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, who was born in India.\n\n\"Her background, her experience, her leadership is an indication of the ways in which so many immigrant communities really just are woven throughout the fabric of this country.\"\n\nA young Harris is seen with her mother, Shyamala, in this photo that was posted on Harris' Facebook page in March 2017. \"She, and so many other strong women in my life, showed me the importance of community involvement and public service,\" Harris wrote.\n\nSome Indian Americans say the moment is a particularly resonant sign of how far the community has come in a matter of decades. Others note that Harris' Indian heritage is just one part of her background and caution against painting a group that is culturally, linguistically and religiously diverse with too broad a brush.\n\nBut there's no doubt that this is a \"first\" that's drawing attention.\n\n\"It's pretty remarkable that you have a population that was numbering in the thousands 50 years ago now on a major presidential ticket,\" says Pawan Dhingra , a professor of American Studies at Amherst College.\n\nDhingra says that reveals a lot about how US immigration policies have influenced who's able to come to the US in the first place, and what happens to generations of families once they're here.\n\nThe US began admitting more Asians and Africans\n\n\"It speaks to how US immigration law privileged certain kind of immigrants, namely those with high education levels and skills in scientific fields, that many Indians, including Kamala Harris' mother, migrated through,\" Dhingra says. \"Once you have a population in the US that is highly educated and highly skilled, then it sets up their kids for certain kinds of achievements and opportunities that can happen within a generation or two.\"\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which eliminated national origin quotas, paved the way for millions of Indians and other non-European immigrants to come to the United States.\n\n\"It fundamentally changed the demographics of the country. It made the country...more Asian and African,\" Dhingra says, \"though that was not its intent.\"\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, the number of Indian immigrants in the United States had dropped so sharply that they didn't even register in official Census tallies, says Devesh Kapur, director of Asia Programs and a professor of South Asian Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nIn 1960, two years after Harris' mother arrived in California to begin her doctoral studies, there were around 12,000 Indian immigrants in the United States. By 2018, the latest census estimates available, there were nearly 2.7 million.\n\n\"Every decade since 1980, it's been almost doubling,\" Kapur says.\n\nSeveral waves of immigration after 1965 shaped the Indian American population, Kapur and his co-authors argue in their 2016 book , \"The Other One Percent.\" The first wave were highly educated immigrants, many of whom, like Harris' mother, came to the United States to study and pursue advanced degrees. Then a large cohort of families migrated to join loved ones already in the United States. Then came a generation of IT workers with visas under the H-1B program for specialty occupations.\n\nNow, according to the Migration Policy Institute , Indian immigrants are the second largest immigrant group in the United States.\n\nHow Harris defines her heritage\n\nShe has spoken out about her mother's upbringing in India in a home \"where political activism and civil leadership came naturally,\" and she's described her childhood memories visiting her grandfather in the southern Indian city of Chennai.\n\n\"My mother instilled in my sister Maya and me the values that would chart the course of our lives,\" Harris said as she accepted the Democratic Party's vice presidential nomination Wednesday night . \"She raised us to be proud, strong Black women, and she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Kamala Harris: Oh, how I wish my mother was here Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kamala Harris: Oh, how I wish my mother was here 01:56\n\nWhen asked last year how she defines herself, given her Indian roots, Harris replied, \"Proud American.\"\n\n\"The more we attend to her Indian American heritage, what I hope that people get out of that is the fact that she's biracial, she's multiracial. That's something we really need to recognize,\" Dhingra says. \" So many more people today are multiracial or at least identify as that. ... What's exciting is that alongside that, she's helping bring out this new normal in America.\"\n\n\"I was raised by a mother who taught us that if you see a problem, you don't complain about it. You do something about it,\" Harris wrote in an Instagram post when she shared this photo last year.\n\nHow Indian Americans vote\n\nHarris' nomination comes as more attention is being paid to Asian Americans' behavior at the polls\n\n\"Asian Americans are now the fastest growing racial and ethnic group in the US, both as a population and as an electorate ,\" says Neil Ruiz, associate director of global migration and demography at the Pew Research Center.\n\nWill having Harris on the ticket influence how Indian Americans vote?\n\nThat's difficult to say, says Kapur, who says he's planning to conduct a survey of Indian American voters to get a better sense of how they feel about Harris' candidacy and other issues in the election.\n\n\"We don't know. ... There are so many factors. People are so polarized in this election already. ... We know that in this election, far more of the electorate has already made up its mind,\" Kapur says.\n\nBut some Indian Americans backed Trump in 2016. And several prominent Indian American politicians are Republicans, including former UN Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.\n\nRepublicans Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal shake hands at the White House in 2015, when both were serving as governors.\n\nWhatever happens at the polls, seeing Harris on the ticket is likely to inspire a new generation to consider careers in politics, says Sanjay Puri, chairman of the US-India Political Action Committee. Already, he says, a growing number of Indian Americans are running for office.\n\n\"It will open the floodgates. ... This will be a seminal moment. You might see this, 10 years, 20 years from now, where there will be young people, people who will be more and more coming into public life because of this,\" he says.\n\n\"Not just Indian Americans, but I think everywhere, the opportunities are there for people...no matter how their name is pronounced, or whatever their background is. I think it serves as a great inspirational story.\"\n\n'An American name'\n\nHarris' first name, Kamala, comes from the Sanskrit word for \"lotus flower.\"\n\nKapur, of Johns Hopkins, says that wasn't a detail he focused on when the Biden campaign announced she'd be on the ticket.\n\n\"For me,\" he says, \"what matters is the larger attributes of this individual, rather than the Indian part.\" But he says his daughter, who recently graduated from college, had a different reaction: \"It's nice to have someone with a name that plays to me, which I recognize.\"\n\n\"It's symbolism, yes,\" Kapur says. \"But symbolism should not be seen as irrelevant.\"\n\nHashmi, the Virginia state senator who unseated an incumbent Republican last year, knows how important names can be. She was four years old when she immigrated to the United States from India in 1969, growing up in a small town in Georgia where for years hers was the only South Asian family in town.\n\nThe tag line she used in her 2019 campaign: \"Ghazala Hashmi is an American name.\"\n\nIt was partially an effort to reach out to voters from immigrant backgrounds who weren't used to seeing themselves represented in political leaders. But Hashmi says the line also had a broader appeal.\n\n\"People, no matter where they came from or who they were or their demographics, that seemed to be a message that they really understood,\" she says. \"America was changing. The face of America was changing. ... I could just see the impact on people's faces. It became a message that really resonated.\"\n\nOn the campaign trial, she says, moms would tell her their little girls had tweaked the tag line, subbing their names in for hers."

On Tuesday, DeJoy reversed course and said that changes being made to the Postal Service would be suspended until after the November election.

Mental exhaustion, too.\"\n\nA day after Gov. Gavin Newsom said almost every firefighting resource in California was battling the blazes, President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration on Saturday that will release federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in areas affected by the wildfires.\n\nThose areas include Lake, Napa, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Solano, Sonoma, and Yolo counties, according to a White House statement.\n\nThough more than 13,000 firefighters are battling the flames -- some on 24-hour shifts -- there are too many fires and not enough resources to prevent more homes from being torched, Cal Fire officials have said\n\nOne of the reasons for a resource shortage: Fewer prison inmates than usual are helping, because of early releases during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nInmate firefighters \"are an integral part of our firefighting operations,\" Cal Fire spokeswoman Christine McMorrow said. The early releases have meant 600 fewer inmate firefighters are available this fire season compared to last year.\n\nFire destroyed dozens of homes at the Spanish Flat Mobile Villa in Napa County this week.\n\n'It's the unknown that hurts,' evacuee says\n\nThe fires, largely sparked by lightning in the past few days, have been exacerbated by dry terrain during a torrid heat wave. And as tens of thousands of people heed evacuation orders, they're weighing the risk of coronavirus infections as they decide whether to head to official shelters.\n\nIn the Lake Berryessa area of Napa County, the LNU fire has turned neighborhoods into piles of ash and debris. At least 560 structures have been destroyed and 125 have been damaged by the wildfire that stretches across five counties, said Sean Kavanaugh, incident commander with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nThe remains of charred vehicles rest Saturday in a neighborhood near Lake Berryessa in Northern California's Napa County.\n\nCharred frames of cars and trucks with melted tires rested on driveways throughout a burned-out neighborhood Saturday, with only a few houses still standing, a CNN crew saw.\n\nFive deer were about the only things stirring.

Last year, wildfires charred a total of 260,000 acres and killed three people, according to Cal Fire.\n\nSarah Hawkins finds a vase in the rubble after her home was destroyed by a fire in Vacaville, California.\n\nFires blanket parts of the West with smoke\n\nFires in California and elsewhere in the West are making for poor air quality, blanketing parts of them and the Great Plains with smoke.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued air quality alerts for parts of at least six states: California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado and New Mexico. These alerts warn of moderate to heavy smoke, and advise people -- especially those with heart disease or respiratory illnesses -- to consider staying indoors and limiting outdoor activity.\n\nSeveral global air quality monitoring websites show levels in California's Bay Area and Central Valley recently have been worse than anywhere else, including locations generally regarded as having the poorest air quality, like India and eastern China.\n\nAs of Saturday, 92 large fires have burned nearly 1.5 million acres in 13 states, including 26 in California, 16 in Oregon, 11 in Arizona and five in Colorado, according to the National Interagency Fire Center\n\nA smoke plume from the LNU Lightning Complex fire billows over Healdsburg, California, on Thursday, August 20.\n\nMore lightning in the forecast\n\nWeather conditions over the next few days could worsen the spread of fires in California and other Western states.\n\nLightning, gusty winds and low humidity could spark new fires and spread existing ones, generally Sunday through Tuesday, National Weather Service forecasters said.\n\nThose concerns are reflected in two kinds of alerts from the weather service:\n\ncovering about 8 million people in parts of four states: California, southern Oregon, Montana and southern Utah. Some were in effect Saturday, but others begin Sunday. Red flag warnings have been issued for areascovering about 8 million people in parts of four states: California, southern Oregon, Montana and southern Utah. Some were in effect Saturday, but others begin Sunday.\n\nThose warnings say conditions likely to start or spread fires will be imminent during the warning period."

  "title_summary": "The sound of India’s AI potential The Sounds of India experiment was made possible by machine learning models built with Google’s TensorFlow platform to convert sounds into musical instruments (in this case, the Bansuri, the Shehnai, and the Sarangi).\n\nIt was a fun, fresh way for Indians to express their national pride, and showcase the traditions of Indian classical music. But it’s also an opportunity to think about AI’s bigger potential for India’s future—something Google is increasingly focused on.\n\nLast year, we started Google Research India , an AI lab based in Bangalore, to advance AI research and apply AI in solving some of India’s biggest challenges. We reinforced that commitment last month, announcing that leveraging technology and AI for social good would be one of the four focus areas for our $10 billion Google for India Digitization Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporting Indians’ health and wellbeing\n\n\n\nIn healthcare, we’re using AI to help people manage their health, focusing on wellbeing and a mobile app for cardio-vascular disease prevention. We're also building on our efforts to apply AI in screening for the eye disease diabetic retinopathy, working with partners like Aravind Eye Hospital and Sankara Nethralaya.\n\nImproving environmental protection and forecasting\n\nOur flood forecasting tools are already being used to send alerts to hundreds of millions of people, and we’re working on computer vision techniques that can analyze satellite imagery to assist with restoring water bodies and protecting forest cover.\n\nHarnessing AI for social good\n\nAs part of our commitment to the broader Indian research community, we’re supporting researchers and NGOs using AI to make further progress on health and environmental problems. Nonprofit ARMMAN and a team from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras are collaborating on a project to predict the risk of expectant mothers dropping out of healthcare programs, while other projects aim to reduce the risk of HIV/Aids, minimize human-wildlife conflict, and improve water release from dams.\n\nOne promising initiative is NGO Wadhwani AI’s work using AI to provide timely, local pest management advice to farmers. With a grant from Google.org’s AI Impact Challenge—and support from our Launchpad Accelerator— Wadhwani AI has started to roll out their solution to detect bollworm, helping farmers monitor pests, take action, and improve crop yield.\n\n\n\nIndependence Day is always a time to reflect on both India’s past and its future. We’re looking forward to building on our progress so far, and working with our partners to bring the benefits of AI to many more Indians in years to come.\n\n"

Vishwanathan and Bank of India Chairman G. Padmanabhan at SPJIMR's webinar on banking and governance in India, in Mumbai. INDIA TOP NEWS • Facebook executive in India files police complaint after report on content practices A top Facebook executive in India has filed a police complaint in New Delhi saying she is receiving death threats after a media report said she and the U.S. social network company allegedly favoured Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party. • Reliance in talks to buy online furniture retail, milk delivery startups Reliance Industries is in talks to buy online furniture retailer Urban Ladder and milk delivery firm Milkbasket to strengthen its e-commerce business, the Times of India newspaper reported on Monday. • Migrants return to Delhi as India's COVID-19 deaths top 50,000 India's COVID-19 deaths topped 50,000 on Monday, five months after the country reported its first such fatality, as migrant workers poured back into major cities in hopes of regaining work after the easing of anti-virus restrictions. • India's power output rises for first time in five months in early August India's electricity generation in the first 15 days of August rose for the first time since early March, provisional government data showed, as the country opened up industries and lifted restrictions to control the spread of coronavirus. GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Joined by some Republicans, Democrats tout Biden's leadership as convention opens Former rival Bernie Sanders and prominent Republican John Kasich joined forces in a display of unity for Joe Biden on Monday, the opening night of a Democratic convention showcasing the broad coalition arrayed against President Donald Trump. • Japan manufacturers' gloom eases slightly but pandemic woes remain Japan's manufacturers were their least pessimistic in four months in August, the Reuters Tankan survey of business sentiment showed, but signalled a slow recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. • U.S. tightening restrictions on Huawei access to technology, chips The Trump administration on Monday announced it will further tighten restrictions on Huawei Technologies, aimed at cracking down on its access to commercially available chips. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading little changed at 11,285.20. • The Indian rupee is expected to trade higher against the U.S. currency, tracking broad dollar weakness and pullback in Treasury yields. • Indian government bond yields may open little changed ahead of a fresh supply of state debt, while market participants await likely bond-supportive measures from the central bank. The yield on the benchmark 5.79% bond maturing in 2030 is likely to trade in a range of 5.95%-6.00%, a trader with a state-run bank said. GLOBAL MARKETS • The Nasdaq surged to a record high close on Monday, while the S&P 500 approached its own record level, with both indexes lifted by Nvidia and other technology stocks. • Asian stocks inched up as Sino-U.S. tensions weighed on optimism generated by Wall Street's tech-driven rally, while the dollar dropped against almost all major currencies. • The dollar teetered near milestone lows, after a triple blow of retreating yields, soft U.S. economic data and a dip in safe-haven demand exerted broad selling pressure. • U.S. Treasury yields fell on Monday, retreating a bit from last week's higher levels as the market awaited a new burst of supply to finance stimulus efforts to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. • Oil prices edged lower, mostly holding onto overnight gains after OPEC+ said the producer grouping is almost fully complying with output cuts to support prices amid a drop in demand for fuels due to the coronavirus pandemic. • Gold prices edged up on the back of a weaker dollar, although gains were capped by a rally in U.S. equities and signs of a recovery in global economic activity.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File photo\n\nU.S. lawmakers negotiating a fresh dose of stimulus have reached an impasse.\n\nTrillions of dollars injected by the Federal Reserve and huge government spending increases have stemmed coronavirus-linked economic damage, fuelling a rebound in a Citi index that tracks economic data relative to expectations.\n\nBut with almost 30 million Americans unemployed and coronavirus still spreading, Fed policymakers have been warning the recovery could sputter unless politicians come through with further measures. The S&P500 index is holding just off record highs. The wait is on to see if negotiations resume and bear fruit.\n\n-White House, Democrats show no sign of budging on U.S. coronavirus aid-COVID-19 crushes U.S. economy in second quarter; rising virus cases loom over recovery\n\n(Graphic: Citi's U.S. economic surprise index )\n\n2/LET’S BREXIT AGAIN\n\nThe twin troubles of Brexit and coronavirus ensured Britain’s second-quarter contraction of 20.4% was greater than any other major economy’s. And recovery will be elusive unless a free-trade deal is reached with the European Union before the post-Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31.\n\nEU-UK talks begin on Aug 17. The two sides remain far apart, but the meetings may show if they can lay aside their differences in time to reach a deal by the Oct. 2 deadline. An impasse may spell trouble for sterling and further pressure on domestic-focused shares.\n\nThe Bank of England is not considering negative interest rates just yet, but the prospect of crashing out of the European Union without a deal might leave it with no alternative.\n\n-UK says it’s confident of Brexit trade deal as EU changing tone\n\n-Brexit talks scheduled just in time for key EU October summit\n\n(Graphic: Poised for losses? )\n\n3/GOLD FOR GREENBACKS\n\nThe dollar’s 5% plunge in five weeks has got gold bugs excited. Prices for the metal vaulted to a record above $2,000 per ounce before retreating as the greenback regained some poise.\n\nDollar weakness could run further -- it remains strong across various trade-weighted indexes. But correlations between gold and the dollar, tenuous at best, have weakened under the impact of central bank stimulus, with 90-day correlations approaching cyclical lows.\n\nFinally, rising inflation expectations boost hedges such as gold. Refinitiv data shows U.S., UK, German and Japanese 10-year real, inflation-adjusted yields in negative territory, a first for all of them simultaneously. So even if gold struggles above $2,000, gold bugs can probably rest assured a big selloff isn’t imminent.\n\n-Fear factor: Investors rush into gold and other havens as stocks near highs.\n\n-Gold climbs as weaker dollar bolsters appeal\n\n(Graphic: Gold - shining bright )\n\n4/DOING THE SPLITS\n\nApple and Tesla’s stock-split announcements rekindle memories of the dotcom bubble, when companies were actively dividing shares into multiple new ones. That trend eventually died -- is it making a comeback?\n\nTesla is giving out five shares for each share held; Apple has a four-for-one offer. Companies typically split shares to make them cheaper for retail investors, but these days, with platforms already offering fractional shares for as little as $1, such splits don’t attract investors in droves.\n\nShares have risen since the announcements, but it remains to be seen whether gains continue until Aug. 31, when trading starts on a split-adjusted basis for both Apple and Tesla.\n\n-Apple’s stock split may not be good for the Dow\n\n-Tesla sets 5-1 stock split and its high-flying stock soars again\n\n(Graphic: Where did all the stock splits go? )\n\n5/THE BIG AUSTRALIAN\n\nThe world’s biggest listed mining company and the third-biggest digger of iron ore, Australia’s BHP, reports annual results on Tuesday.\n\nWith iron ore prices soaring and rival Rio Tinto beating forecasts, strong numbers are expected of BHP. But BHP is more than just a miner -- steel is a bellwether for economic growth and its main ingredient, iron ore, sits at a critical juncture. Many question whether Chinese demand is enough to offset crumbling orders elsewhere.\n\nBHP is also a gauge of China’s economic health. After July shipments to China from the world’s largest export hub, Australia’s Port Hedland, dipped 17.5% from June, investors will be listening out for management’s view on the outlook.\n\n-Australia’s Port Hedland iron ore exports to China fall 17.5% in July\n\n-BHP hits record iron ore output but warns of risks from virus\n\n(Graphic: China iron ore imports )"

The limit was finally set at 5% after complaints from some sectors and fears it may dissuade foreign firms from investing or sharing technology.\n\nRecently however, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has made a renewed push to make the country a major manufacturing hub by encouraging domestic production and curbing imports. It also wants to increase local investment and reduce foreign outflows.\n\nWhile India does not restrict the amount that can be paid as royalty, any payment by a locally listed company exceeding 5% of revenues needs shareholder approval.\n\nListed companies such as Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS and parts makers including Bosch BOSH.NS, Schaeffler India SCHE.NS and Wabco India WABC.NS typically pay royalties of between 1%-5% to their foreign owners.\n\nMaruti Suzuki paid 38.2 billion rupees ($510 million) as royalty to its Japanese parent Suzuki Motor 7269.T in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, amounting to 5% of its revenue, according to its annual report.\n\nPrivately-owned companies such as Hyundai's local unit paid $150 million or 2.6% of revenue as royalties to its South Korean parent in fiscal 2019 and Toyota Motor's 7203.T India arm paid $88 million or 3.4% of revenue to its Japanese parent, government data shows.\n\nRoyalty provision has been important in attracting foreign investments into various sectors in India, especially autos, said Vaibhav Gupta, partner at tax firm, Dhruva Advisors.\n\n“Depending on the form in which the government brings back such caps ... it may impact the ability of auto companies to benefit from the use of foreign brands and technical know-how,” said Gupta.\n\nHe said for many foreign companies royalties are a profit repatriation strategy and changes to these could impact operating and supply chain structures from a fiscal perspective.\n\nMaruti, Toyota and Bosch declined to comment. Hyundai, Schaeffler and Wabco did not respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nSuch payments have also been a long-standing issue with minority shareholders.\n\nA February report by proxy firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services showed royalty paid by 31 leading Indian companies with foreign parents, including Maruti and Bosch, grew 9% in fiscal year 2019 to total $1.11 billion."

Since then, demonstrations organised by student groups have taken place almost daily.\n\nThere was strong student representation at the protest on Sunday, but there were also many older people among the crowds.\n\nWHAT ARE THE PROTESTERS DEMANDING?\n\nThe are three key demands: For Prayuth’s government to step down, for a new constitution to be drawn up and for an end to the harassment of opposition activists.\n\nBut some students have also presented 10 demands for reforms to the powerful monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.\n\nThese include curbs on his constitutional powers as well as his authority over the palace fortune and armed forces. They also want an end to the monarchy’s role in politics, but emphasise they are not seeking to abolish it.\n\nSuch public demands for change by any group are unprecedented in living memory.\n\nWHAT IS DRIVING THE GRIEVANCES?\n\nOpponents of Prayuth accuse him of maintaining the power he first seized in a 2014 coup through an election last year that was held under rules that favoured him. He disputes this.\n\nOther factors have also emerged, including anger over accusations of government corruption and a feeling that the Thai elite acts with impunity. Meanwhile, poverty has been exacerbated by the collapse of the crucial tourist industry as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe disappearance of a Thai anti-government activist in Cambodia, the latest of nine to go missing in recent years, has fuelled disaffection.\n\nMany young Thais also voice frustration with an establishment that emphasises obedience to authorities and tradition, with the monarchy described by the constitution as “enthroned in a position of revered worship”.\n\nHOW HAS THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED?\n\nThe government has said that people are allowed to show dissent and Prayuth has said he seeks dialogue with the protesters.\n\nBut three student protest leaders have already been arrested and released on bail on charges over the earlier protests, and police say there are warrants for the arrest of a further 12.\n\nPrayuth has said the king has requested him not to use the lese majeste laws that provide for up to 15 years in prison for anyone insulting the monarchy.\n\nWHAT OPPOSITION IS THERE TO THE PROTESTERS?\n\nThere have been a handful of pro-monarchy demonstrations to counter the anti-government protests, but even the biggest has drawn no more than a few dozen people.\n\nThose have included former members of the strongly royalist yellow shirts, who for more than a decade before the last coup had clashed with red shirt protesters loyal to former populist prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.\n\nSome former red shirts have meanwhile appeared at the anti-government protests.\n\nThis has stirred concerns in Thailand that there could be a return to the street violence of the past, although so far the protests have been peaceful.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nProtesters have vowed to continue taking action until their demands are met.\n\nThe protests, and particularly the criticism of the monarchy, have put the government in a bind.\n\nPolitical analysts have said that if it acts too harshly, it risks provoking a backlash that will further encourage support for the protests. If it does not take strong action, however, the protesters may be further emboldened to break longstanding taboos."

  "title_summary": "Column: Megacities after coronavirus LONDON (Reuters) - Densely populated and highly connected megacities such as London and New York have been the most dynamic centres of the modern economy but for the same reasons have proved especially vulnerable to the coronavirus.\n\nAn advertising sign is seen in the window of a medical clinic, amid the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in London, Britain August 24, 2020. REUTERS/John Sibley\n\nDensity and connectedness have supported a wealth of innovation and high productivity, but crowded housing, workspaces and transport systems have created ideal conditions for the transmission of pulmonary disease.\n\nRegional, national and international connectedness ensured megacities were the first to receive the virus, and then transmitted it onward to secondary and tertiary cities and eventually rural areas.\n\nHigh density ensured that once the virus had entered a megacity it would spread quickly and cause high death rates, forcing urban lockdowns to bring transmission back under control.\n\nThe coronavirus has intensified a pre-existing debate about the future of megacities, and whether the concentration of so much population and economic activity in a few large centres is desirable.\n\nLong before the epidemic, analysts and policymakers had begun to question the distribution of activity between megacities and other primary cities on the one hand, and secondary and tertiary cities on the other.\n\nPrior to the epidemic, the question was whether megacities had become too dominant, leaving other areas behind, and too unaffordable; now it is also whether they have become too unsafe and can recapture their past benefits.\n\nMegacities still have advantages, but improvements in communications and the mass experiment in remote working have sharpened questions about whether some activity could relocate to secondary cities and other areas.\n\nLONDON\n\nLondon is the quintessential megacity: densely populated; intensely connected at regional, national and international levels; and exceptionally productive compared with other cities and regions in the United Kingdom.\n\nLondon has more in common economically with other megacities - such as New York, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Tokyo, Sydney, Auckland, Paris, Beijing and Shanghai - than with most other parts of Britain.\n\nLike other megacities, London’s population has boomed over the last three decades, hitting a record of 9 million in 2019, up from just 6.4 million in 1991, according to the UK Office for National Statistics.\n\nHowever, before that, the city’s population had slumped for five decades from a previous peak of 8.6 million in 1941, as inhabitants fled the city for more space and other improvements outside the metropolitan area.\n\nMIGRATION\n\nLike other megacities, London’s population shows exceptional levels of turnover compared with secondary cities and other non-metropolitan areas.\n\nLondon is at the heart of two enormous circulations, exchanging population with other regions of the United Kingdom (especially adjacent regions in Southeast and East England), as well as internationally.\n\nEvery year, the British capital sees a large net outflow of adults aged 30 years and over to other regions of the country, which is partially replenished by a large net inflow of adults aged 20-29 years.\n\nIn the 12 months to June 2019, London saw a net outflow of almost 88,000 adults aged over 30, partially offset by a net inflow of 46,000 adults aged 20-29 from other regions.\n\nLondon is the only major region of Britain that sees a net outflow of over-30s, and one of only two regions that see a net inflow of 20-29 year olds (the other being the Northwest), confirming the distinctiveness of its population and economy.\n\nOverall, however, London has lost population to the rest of the country every year for the last decade, relying on international migration to replenish its population and achieve growth.\n\nIn the year to June 2018, London saw an outflow of 103,000 people to other regions of the United Kingdom, which was more than replaced by an inflow of 113,000 from other countries.\n\nThe city’s net domestic outflow has been accelerating as it becomes more crowded and expensive, hitting a peak of 107,000 in 2016/17, up from 69,000 in 2013/14 and 32,000 in 2008/09.\n\nLike other megacities, London is overwhelmingly young, relying on inward migration of the young from other regions and international recruitment to replace its loss of older inhabitants.\n\nYoung workers come from the rest of the country and overseas seeking better employment opportunities, while some older inhabitants leave seeking more affordable housing, more space and other lifestyle improvements.\n\nLondon’s population circulation is similar to other megacities such as New York, San Francisco, Auckland, Sydney and China’s top-tier cities, including Wuhan where the pandemic began.\n\nPOPULATION\n\nThe future population and economic activity of megacities depends on how coronavirus and other factors impact these massive inter-regional and inter-national migrations.\n\nIn the very short term, lasting perhaps a year, the epidemic is likely to lead to a fall in population in London and other megacities.\n\nHealth concerns and the desire for more space are likely to prompt accelerated outward migration, especially among older residents, while lack of job opportunities and curbs on international travel will temporarily curb inward migration.\n\nIn the medium and longer term, the question is whether megacities can restart their inward flow of migrants from other regions and countries to offset their older population losses.\n\nIn part, that will depend on the deployment of an effective vaccine and other control measures to reduce coronavirus transmission in densely populated areas.\n\nBut it also depends on whether megacities can resume attracting international migrants once travel restrictions are eased.\n\nBritain’s exit from the European Union, the developing U.S.-China cold war, rising nationalism in many countries, and de-globalisation could make migration to megacities more restricted in future.\n\nThese cities will have to prove they continue to offer superior employment opportunities and incomes compared with other areas, enough to offset their substantially higher cost of living.\n\nAnd they will have to maintain that benefit-cost advantage in an environment where central offices may play a smaller role and there is likely to be more remote working.\n\nFinally, policymakers must also decide whether to try to reinforce the attractiveness of megacities, or exploit the epidemic to try, once again, to disperse more activity to secondary and tertiary centres.\n\nMegacities generate enormous amounts of output, high-paying employment and tax revenues, but political cohesion favours a more even distribution of activity to other urban and semi-urban areas.\n\nPolicymakers in megacities, other regions and national level may have contrasting views on the desirability of any rebalancing of population and economic activity to other cities and regions.\n\nLondon’s population history over the last century shows the relentless growth of megacities is not inevitable or irreversible but contingent on their relative attractiveness to different age cohorts and openness to both inter-regional and inter-national migrants."

While the number of new cases is down from a peak in July, the country is still seeing over 360,000 new cases a week.\n\nMany public schools and universities reopened classrooms to students despite positive test rates of nearly 20% in some parts of the country. Less than a week after welcoming students, some schools are switching to online-only learning due to a spike in infections.\n\nIn India, the world’s second-most populous country, COVID-19 deaths topped 50,000 on Monday, five months after the country reported its first coronavirus fatality.\n\nIndia is only the third country, behind Brazil and the United States, to record more than 2 million infections. It has a relatively low case fatality rate of 1.9%, compared to the world average of 3.5%, but that may be due to underreporting.\n\nCase fatality rates are about 3% in the United States and Brazil.\n\nHealth experts have raised the alarm that Brazil and the United States still have no coordinated plan to fight the pandemic, as many officials focus on reopening schools and businesses, which is likely to worsen the outbreak.\n\nBrazil’s death toll from COVID-19 passed 100,000 on Aug. 8 and continues to climb as most Brazilian cities reopen shops and dining even though the pandemic has yet to peak there."

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nDrugmakers are racing to combat the pandemic, which has killed about 810,000 people and infected roughly 24 million.\n\nThere are no approved vaccines for COVID-19, but AstraZeneca’s vaccine is widely seen as one of the leading candidates, with reports that the United States is aiming for a fastrack approval before the November presidential election.\n\nThe company has been granted protection from future product liability claims related to the vaccine by most of the countries with which it has so far struck supply agreements, a senior executive told Reuters.\n\nBelow are the main details of the vaccine and its supply and production deals.\n\nTYPE\n\n- The shot, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, is a recombinant viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University.\n\n- It was licensed to AstraZeneca in April.\n\n- The vaccine candidate uses a weakened version of a chimpanzee common-cold virus that encodes instructions for making proteins from the novel coronavirus to build immunity.\n\nPROTECTION DURATION\n\n- The shot is likely to provide protection for about a year, and the company is leaning towards a two-dose strategy for the potential vaccine.\n\nEXPECTED COST\n\n- AstraZeneca says it will be able to manufacture the vaccine at a few dollars per dose.\n\n- Pricing in Latin America, while still not final, is not expected to exceed $4 per dose, said AstraZeneca’s Mexico head.\n\n- India’s Serum Institute said it will price the shot at $3 per dose for the country and other emerging economies.\n\n- According to Italy’s health ministry, an AZD1222 shot would cost about 2.5 euros ($2.8) per dose in Europe.\n\n- AstraZeneca does not expect to profit from the vaccine candidate during the pandemic.\n\n- Costs in other regions have not been disclosed.\n\nTRIALS\n\n- AstraZeneca’s CEO said good data had come in so far on the vaccine, after early-stage trials showed it was safe and produced an immune response.\n\n- Trials at different stages are underway in Britain, Brazil, South Africa, United States and India. Russia has okayed trials as well.\n\n- Talks are ongoing with Mexico, and a smaller early-stage study is being conducted in South Africa to see how the vaccine works in those with HIV.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n- Data could be given to regulators this year.\n\n- The vaccine could be rolled out by year-end, but there is no certainty of that, the lead developer said in July.\n\n- Data from late-stage studies is expected around September.\n\n- Delivery of the first doses is expected between September and October.\n\n- Experts have predicted a safe and effective vaccine could take 12-18 months to develop.\n\nTARGET DOSES\n\n- 3 billion currently.\n\nTIE-UPS\n\n- Even before conclusive evidence of the vaccine’s success or failure, AstraZeneca has signed deals to produce and supply the shot. With U.S. backing, the company also tied up with IQVIA in July to speed up trials.\n\nAstraZeneca is also in talks with Spain."

Mandatory Credit: Mark Konezny-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTwo weeks after entering the last round of the PGA Championships with a one stroke advantage and unable to close the deal, Johnson was under far less pressure at TPC Boston but he ensured there would be no repeat, turning a five shot 54-hole cushion into a commanding 11 stroke victory.\n\n“Obviously you can learn some stuff from the PGA, but I didn’t feel like I really did anything wrong at the PGA. I played pretty solid on Sunday,” said Johnson.\n\n“Generally, you shoot 68 on Sunday in a major with the lead on a tough golf course, you’re going to win most of the time.”\n\nIf anyone in the field was harboring thoughts of reeling in Johnson, the 36-year-old American quickly put those to rest when he opened his round with an eagle on the par five second and added four birdies to go six-under on his outward nine.\n\nFrom that point the only one rain on Johnson’s party was from Mother Nature who forced a weather delay with two holes to play.\n\nJohnson completed his round with a birdie on 18 for an eight-under 63 and a winning total of 30-under 254, leaving Harris English a distant runner-up on 19-under.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nJohnson’s 30-under fell just one stroke short of the PGA Tour record for most strokes under par.\n\nEnglish made a brave attempt early on to keep pace with Johnson, dropping four birdies on his outward nine, but in the end was helpless, signing for a 69 as a rampaging Johnson pulled away.\n\nDaniel Berger (67) finished alone in third 12 off the pace with Kevin Kisner (66) and Scottie Scheffler (71) one further back.\n\n“It is a big margin, and I’m definitely really proud of that. I played really good,” said Johnson.\n\nI’ve never shot 30-under in four rounds. Just something that I wanted to do.”\n\nTiger Woods, fighting for enough points to secure a spot in the FedExCup final in East Lake, Atlanta, helped his cause by signing off with his best round of the year, a five-under 66.\n\nWoods did all his work on the front nine with four straight birdies to open his round and five in his first seven holes. But the 15-time major winner could not sustain the momentum, his charge stalling after the turn with nine straight pars to finish at six-under, a massive 24 shots back of Johnson.\n\nRory McIlroy, the defending FedEx Cup champion, closed out a disappointing week with a two-under 69 to leave the Northern Irishman just four from the bottom of the leaderboard.\n\nThis week’s tournament was the first of three playoff events that culminate with the Sept. 4-7 Tour Championship in Atlanta and the $15 million prize to the FedExCup champion.\n\nOnly the top 70 in the standings after this week go on to the BMW Championship at Olympia Fields outside Chicago, and from there the top 30 move on to Atlanta."

Shares touched their highest since June 2018 in the previous session.\n\nAntofagasta’s mines have operated with about two-thirds of the usual workforce on site because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDisruptions to mining operations in Chile, the world’s largest producer of mined copper, have been minimal, but helped to delay mining projects.\n\nAntofagasta said a six-month delay to its flagship Los Pelambres mine had cost it $50 million. It said work on all projects had resumed in stages.\n\nThe redesigning of a desalination plant at Los Pelambres would cost an additional $150 million.\n\nOther costs are lower, however, due to cheaper fuel and a weaker local currency, and Antofagasta reiterated its full-year targets for production, costs and spending.\n\nRealised copper prices were 12.5% lower in the first half compared to a year ago, while sales were down 2.2%, Antofagasta said.\n\nThis pressured the miner’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), down 22% to $1.01 billion for the six months ended June 30.\n\nPrices of copper, used in power and construction, have rebounded nearly 50% from lows in March to around $6,600 per tonne, lifted by supply concerns and higher demand from top consumer China.\n\nAntofagasta, which cut its 2019 final dividend by $70 million in May, declared an interim payout that was 42% lower at 6.2 cents per share compared to the same period last year.\n\nThis was still in line with its policy of paying a minimum of 35% of underlying net earnings and was slightly ahead of consensus.\n\n“It (the interim dividend) does indicate that the Antofagasta team feels it and its operations have adjusted to the present situation and operations are running well,” Peter Mallin-Jones, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said.\n\nAntofagasta’s bigger London-listed rivals BHP , Anglo American and Rio Tinto have also kept dividends, although Glencore has not.\n\nLooking to the longer term, a final investment decision will be made in early 2022 on a second concentrator at the Centinela mine, whose cost is expected to be around $2 billion, versus the $2.7 billion previously estimated, CEO Iván Arriagada told Reuters.

The dollar’s gain put it on track to break an eight-week losing streak.\n\nTraders work in front of the German share price index, DAX board, at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, May 8, 2017. REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/Files\n\nEven as new COVID-19 cases remain stubbornly high across the United States, data firm IHS Markit’s purchasing managers’ survey showed U.S. business activity in August snapped back to the highest since early 2019 on Friday.\n\nThe flash U.S. Composite PMI Index rose to a reading of 54.7 this month - the highest since February 2019 - from 50.3 in July. Its flash - or preliminary - indicator for the manufacturing sector stood at its highest since January 2019 and for the services sector it was the highest since March 2019.\n\nReadings of more than 50 indicate growth in private sector output.\n\nStronger-than-expected U.S. home sales, which rose at a record pace for the second straight month, also pointed to a growing economy.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 0.26%, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.09% and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.29%.\n\nAmong global shares, MSCI's benchmark for global equity markets .MIWD00000PUS was off its lows for the day, down 0.41% to 569.62, while its index for emerging markets stocks .MSCIEF fell 1.72%.\n\nEurope's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 dropped 0.29% to 1,415.22.\n\nA steep rise in jobless claims on Thursday and Federal Reserve minutes on Wednesday suggested the economy was beginning to stall a little bit, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.\n\nThose “were a little disappointing,” Arone said. With elevated risks, investors are seeking safe-havens.\n\n“Investors are exiting some of the more economically sensitive sectors of the market and going back to the old stalwarts of tech, where you get reliable growth,” Arone said.\n\nTreasuries Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 0.6428%, from 0.644% late on Thursday.\n\nThe 30-year bond last rose 9/32 in price to yield 1.3661%, from 1.377%.\n\nSombre economic numbers earlier in the day in Europe, including euro zone data pointing to a faltering recovery, doused stock market gains in Asia overnight, and also caused the euro to recoil further from recent peaks.\n\nThe loss of momentum came after fresh numbers painting a muted economic outlook, with purchasing managers’ index releases from France and Germany as well as the wider euro zone falling short of expectations, flagging slowing momentum in the recovery.\n\n“The eurozone flash PMIs for August paint a rather muted picture for the single currency area’s nascent economic recovery,” said Moritz Degler, senior economist at Oxford Economics.\n\n“The survey contains some strong evidence that the recovery has slowed in August, particularly in the services sector,” Degler added.\n\nAnalysts pointed to rising infection numbers having tempered economic activity. On Thursday, France saw a post-lockdown record in new infections, while countries across the region imposed fresh travel restrictions.\n\nNews that Pfizer PFE.N reported positive early data from a potential COVID-19 vaccine and could be on track to seek regulatory review by October did little to brighten the mood.\n\nEuropean bourses had started the day on a brighter note, following gains in Asia after U.S. tech shares closed higher on Thursday. The S&P 500 has rallied 54% from its March low in a world awash with monetary and fiscal stimulus, but money managers are questioning the future trajectory.\n\n“We think equity markets, certain credit markets, and the U.S. dollar have yet to fully reflect the long-term impact of ultra-loose Fed policy,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nIn currency markets, the dollar index .DXY jumped 0.68%, on track to end what would have been a ninth consecutive weekly decline. Meanwhile the euro extended losses to drop as much as 0.7% to $1.1776, its lowest level in nearly 10 days.\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.19% to 105.99 per dollar.\n\nIn commodity markets, oil prices were on track for a small weekly loss, with Brent crude futures slipping to $44.29 a barrel and U.S. crude future to $42.24 a barrel.\n\nGold was a touch softer at $1,935.31 an ounce."

The economy contracted 5.32% in April-June from a year earlier.\n\nShe expected July-September GDP within a range of -2% to 0%, but maintained her 2020 outlook of between -1.1% to 0.2%.\n\n“We will see if the trend continues in August, whether we can stay in the zone of near 0% and we can continue to guard against falling into recession,” she said.\n\nIn January-July, total state revenue fell 12.4% on year, while total spending rose 1.3%.\n\nJust over a quarter of the nearly $50 billion fund set aside to ease the impact of the pandemic on businesses and households had been disbursed, she said.\n\nEconomists have criticised the government for spending too slowly and Indrawati said the government was working to accelerate expenditure, including by redesigning programmes that might not work.\n\nShe listed new programmes, such as additional cash transfers for low income workers and an additional 11.2 trillion rupiah ($765 million) in government funds placed in provincial development banks, among efforts to prop up economic growth.\n\nThe minister expects the country’s fiscal deficit to be 6.34% of GDP, with the government having earmarked $187 billion for its 2020 budget.\n\n“Our outlook depends very much on consumption and investment and the government will use our instruments to support the recovery,” she said.

India accounted for 27% of new cases and nearly 450,000 deaths.\n\nThe nearly 70-day national lockdown enforced in India in late March left millions of TB sufferers with little to no access to crucial drugs, doctors and follow-up treatments.\n\nHealth experts have raised concerns that the pandemic has overwhelmed India’s precarious healthcare system, with most medical personnel and services pushed into the fight against COVID-19 while placing TB care on the back-burner.\n\nAlthough restrictions have eased since June, people have remained too scared to go to medical facilities or been turned away for reasons ranging from staff shortage to confusion over COVID-19 and TB diagnoses.\n\nSymptoms for both include coughing, sometimes with mucus, chest pains, weakness and fever.\n\n“A month or two into the pandemic and TB services were in complete disarray,” said Chapal Mehra, of the advocacy group Survivors Against TB.\n\n“This pandemic is a wake-up call that our healthcare systems are not set up adequately and unable to withstand a crisis.”\n\nUNDER-DETECTION\n\nIndia’s coronavirus outbreak is the third worst in the world behind the United States and Brazil, with nearly 2.4 million confirmed cases and more than 47,000 deaths by mid-August, according to a tally by the Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIts impact on TB care has been immediate - under-detection of a disease that is exacerbated by undernourishment, according to the health ministry.\n\nThe government’s TB programme showed registration of new cases between January and June this year dropped by more than 25% compared with the same period in 2019.\n\nUnder-detection could result in an additional estimated 87,711 TB deaths in 2020, according to a review article co-authored by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease published last month.\n\nHealth experts worry this could derail India’s plan to eliminate the disease by 2025 - five years ahead of the global target.\n\nBut Kuldeep Singh Sachdeva, head of the government’s Central TB Division, said while the pandemic has had a “palpable impact” on TB care, it was unlikely to affect the deadline.\n\nHe said new behaviours adopted in the wake of COVID-19, such as wearing masks and social distancing, could help reduce TB, which is spread through coughs and sneezes.\n\nHe also said that the government had anticipated a decrease in TB notifications due to the lockdown.\n\n“We will be able to cover that dip in coming months,” he said.\n\nHe said health services had resumed and his department was pushing combined testing for both TB and COVID-19, with about 50,000 done so far.\n\nAuthorities have also ramped up awareness campaigns on TB and assessment calls with state officials, and provided helplines for people facing diagnosis or treatment trouble.\n\nSachdeva said patients who had started treatment pre-lockdown had drugs delivered to their doors.\n\nFOOD INSECURITY\n\nJanender, who declined to give his full name, said although he did not get medicines at home, he had no problems with his treatment during the pandemic.\n\n“Once a month I stock up on my medicines. It has been seamless,” said the 26-year-old, who was diagnosed in December, as he waited for a check-up at a New Delhi hospital.\n\nManju Devi, 32, however, had to restart her medication after she failed to pick them up for two weeks during the lockdown.\n\n“There was no transport on the road and the police were beating those venturing out,” said her husband Ram Chela from Lakhimpur Kheri of northern Uttar Pradesh state.\n\nThe lockdown not only restricted movement, but pushed millions into hunger and poverty as they lost jobs.\n\nIn response India promised free food, including 5 kgs (11 lbs) rice or wheat and lentils, to 800 million people.\n\nBut economists and campaigners said few of those in need are registered with the federal food welfare scheme, or have the documents needed to secure benefits.\n\nDr. Hemant Deepak Shewade, who co-authored The Union article, said the lockdown may double levels of poverty and exacerbate food insecurity in India, where undernutrition in adults accounts for up to 44% of TB cases.\n\nAlthough the government provides 500 rupees ($7) as nutritional support to registered TB patients, Shewade urged the transfer of 7,500 rupees and more grains to the poorest, and a boost in rural jobs to improve diets.\n\n“The current amount of rations ... covers only half of the calorie requirements,” he said.\n\n‘DOUBLE STIGMA’\n\nWhile TB services gradually pick up, health experts were concerned that people were still reluctant to visit local facilities.\n\n“People are not coming to the public health facilities because there is deep stigma attached to COVID-19 and TB – it’s like a double stigma,” said Subrat Mohanty, head of Project Axshya, a civil society initiative that supports the government’s TB programme to detect and diagnose cases.\n\nHe said the project, which is funded by The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, stopped between April and June, so there were no door-to-door case findings, sputum tests or health camps.\n\nWith lack of access to healthcare, harsh side effects of a cocktail of drugs and isolation, patients can develop mental health problems, including anxiety and depression, said Mehra of Survivors Against TB. “Basically motivation to continue medication becomes zero,” he said.\n\nThat was the case for Brijesh too.\n\nHe was initially relieved to stop his nine month course of medication that he said made him cranky, drowsy and nauseated.\n\nBut without treatment for nearly three months, he said he worried about transmitting the disease to his family or becoming multi drug-resistant - a major public health crisis in India.\n\nHe said it had been impossible to get drugs since his village was one of the worst-affected in this year’s floods.\n\n\"I'm just scared now. If I go to a hospital, I can catch (the coronavirus). If I don't my TB will get worse. What if I die?\" he said.

You don’t defend well you get punished. No need for insight tonight,” Ferdinand tweeted after United were condemned to their third semi-final exit of the season, following the FA Cup and the League Cup.\n\nFerdinand’s present day peer Harry Maguire, bought last year from Leicester City for 80 million pounds to shore up United’s leaky defence, told BT Sport: “We conceded from two crosses which is not good enough.\n\n“Losing is not acceptable. Getting to semi-finals isn’t acceptable. We have to take it to the next step.”\n\nA pair of innocuous-looking crosses from either flank led to Sevilla’s goals as United’s defenders, positioned like statues in their area, allowed the ball to travel across the face of goal to the scorers.\n\nSuso swept in the equaliser and Luuk De Jong was given all the time and space in the world to slot home the winner after Victor Lindelof switched off.\n\nFernandes and Lindelof almost came to blows after De Jong’s goal, which summed up a miserable evening for United, who missed numerous gilt-edged chances at the other end.\n\nSevilla’s Moroccan goalkeeper Yassine Bono kept out a string of sitters but Fernandes, Marcus Rashford and, in particular, Anthony Martial will rue not putting away chances when United were on top.\n\n“We played a great game and created a lot of chances but in football it’s not enough - we missed a lot in front of goal,” conceded Fernandes."
